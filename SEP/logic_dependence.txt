Dependence Logic
First published Thu Feb 23, 2017; substantive revision Mon Mar 22, 2021





Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic which adds to it

dependence atoms
, that is, expressions of the form

=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
 which assert that the value of 
y
 is
functionally dependent on (in other words, determined by) the values
of 
x
1
…
x
n
. These atoms permit the specification of
non-linearly ordered 
dependency patterns
 between variables,
much in the same sense of IF-Logic 
slashed quantifiers
; but,
differently from IF-logic, dependence logic separates quantification
from the specification of such dependence/independence conditions.



The principal semantics of dependence logic, called 
team
semantics
, generalizes Tarski’s semantics by letting
expressions be satisfied or not satisfied with respect to

sets
 of variable assignments rather than with respect to
single assignments. This semantics pre-dates the development of
dependence logic proper, and it was originally developed by Wilfrid
Hodges in the context of IF-logic (Hodges 1997). There also exists a
game-theoretic semantics for dependence logic, based on games of
imperfect information and roughly analogous to the game-theoretic
semantics for independence-friendly logic (Väänänen
2007a). 
Sensu stricto
, the term “dependence
logic” refers exclusively to the language obtained by adding the
above-mentioned functional dependence atoms to the language of
first-order logic; but the term is also used, in a more general sense,
to refer to the the area of research that studies the properties of
logics obtained by adding various 
notions of dependence and
independence
 to first order logic, such as 
independence
logic
 (Grädel & Väänänen 2013),

intuitionistic dependence logic
 (Yang 2013) or 
inclusion
logic
 (Galliani 2012, Galliani & Hella 2013), or even those
of logics extending 
other
 logical frameworks through similar
atoms, as in the case of 
modal dependence logic

(Väänänen 2008).


 In this article, the term “dependence logic” will be
used to refer to dependence logic proper, and the term “logics
of dependence and independence” will instead be used to refer to
its variants and generalizations.

1. Dependency patterns in first order logic and its extensions



One feature of first order logic which accounts for much of its
expressivity and applicability is the fact that it allows quantifiers
to be 
nested
, and, hence, it permits the specification of

dependency patterns
 between quantified variables. Consider,
for example, the (hopefully false) statement that “every boy
loves some girl that loves some other boy”. It can be
straightforwardly translated into first order logic as 


∀
x
(
BOY
(
x
)
→
∃
y
(
GIRL
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
x
,
y
)
∧
∃
z
(
BOY
(
z
)
∧
x
≠
z
∧
LOVES
(
y
,
z
)
)
)
)



whose truth condition, according to Tarski’s usual semantics, is
precisely what one would expect: the above expression is true if and
only if for every boy 
b
 it is possible to find a girl 
g
 and a
boy 
b
′
 such that 
b
 loves 
g
 and 
g
 loves 
b
′
 and

b
 and 
b
′
 are not the same. The identity of the girl 
g
 may
of course depend on the identity of the first boy 
b
—after
all, for this expression to be true we do not require that all boys
are in love with all girls—and, furthermore, the identity of the
second boy 
b
′
 may depend on 
both
 the identity of the
first boy 
b
 (since 
b
′
 must be different from 
b
) and from
the identity of the girl 
g
 that 
b
 loves. So the 
dependency
pattern
 between our quantified variables is as follows: 
y

depends on 
x
, while 
z
 depends on both 
x
 and 
y
. From a
syntactic perspective, this is reflected by the fact that 
∃
y
 is in the 
scope
 of 
∀
x
 while 
∃
z
 is
in the scope of both 
∀
x
 and 
∃
y
.



Differences in the dependency patterns between operators can be used
to formalize important distinctions, such as for example the one
between the continuity of a function 
f
 


∀
x
∀
ϵ
∃
δ
∀
x
′
(
|
x
−
x
′
|
<
δ
→
|
f
(
x
)
−
f
(
x
′
)
|
<
ϵ
)



and its uniform continuity 


∀
ϵ
∃
δ
∀
x
∀
x
′
(
|
x
−
x
′
|
<
δ
→
|
f
(
x
)
−
f
(
x
′
)
|
<
ϵ
)



or, in intensional extensions of first order logic, to express the
difference between 
De Dicto
 and 
De Re
 readings
(e.g., “It is possible for every person to be crazy” may
be understood either as stating that it for every person 
p
, it is
possible for 
p
 to be crazy, 
∀
x
(
PERSON
(
x
)
→
⬦
CRAZY
(
x
)
)
, or as stating that it is
possible that everyone is crazy together, 
⬦
∀
x
(
PERSON
(
x
)
→
CRAZY
(
x
)
)
).



Dependency patterns between quantified variables in first order logic
are necessarily 
transitive
, as it is made evident by their
connections with the scopes of the corresponding sub-expressions: if

∃
y
 is in the scope of 
∀
x
 and 
∃
z
 is in
the scope of 
∃
y
 then necessarily 
∃
z
 will be in
the scope of (and, therefore, dependent from) 
∀
x
.
Furthermore, the set of all quantifiers in whose scope some subformula

α
 lies is linearly ordered: if 
α
 is in the scope of

Q
1
x
1
 and 
Q
2
x
2
, then either 
Q
1
x
1
 is in the scope
of 
Q
2
x
2
 or vice versa.



This limits the expressive possibilities of first order logic. For
example, let us suppose that we wish to amend our previous assertion
about boys and girls as follows: every boy loves some girl that loves
some other boy, and this second boy can be chosen independently on the
first one. What this means, intuitively speaking, is simple enough:
for every boy 
b
 we can find a girl 
g
 such that 
b
 loves

g
, and for every such girl we can find a boy 
b
′
 such that

g
 loves 
b
′
 and 
b
≠
b
′
, and furthermore we can find
the identity of the second boy 
b
′
 without knowing that of 
b
,
on the basis of the identity of the girl 
g
 alone. This can still
be the true in some scenarios, such as for example if two boys 
b
1

and 
b
2
 love respectively two girls 
g
1
 and 
g
2
, who
however love only 
b
2
 and 
b
1
 respectively. However, it is
easily seen that it is not equivalent to our previous statement: for
example, if our universe consists (as in (b) above) of two boys 
b

and 
b
′
 and a girl 
g
, and 
b
 and 
b
′
 both love 
g
 who
loves both of them, then our previous assertion is true but the
current one is false.







Two scenarios in which (
1
) is true. In (a), 
z

can be chosen independently from 
x
; in (b), it cannot.





However, it is not clear how to formalize this condition in first
order logic. In essence, we would need to modify
(
1
) so that 
z
 is not in the scope of 
x
,
and hence it does not depend on it; however, we would still want 
z

to depend on 
y
 and 
y
 on 
x
. As just discussed, however,
such a dependency pattern is not realizable in first-order logic. We
can sidestep the issue by resorting to higher-order quantification:
indeed, one can see that the expression 


∃
F
∀
x
(
BOY
(
x
)
→
∃
y
(
GIRL
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
x
,
y
)
∧
BOY
(
F
(
y
)
)
∧
x
≠
F
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
y
,
F
(
y
)
)
)
)



captures our intended interpretation, but only at the cost of explicit
existential quantification over functions.



A possible alternative would be to expand the syntax of first order
logic in order to lift the restrictions about dependency patterns
between quantified variables. This is the route taken by 
branching
quantifier logic
 (Henkin 1961), in which the truth conditions of (
2
)
correspond to those of 


(
∀
x
∃
y
∀
z
∃
w
)
(
BOY
(
x
)
→
(
GIRL
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
x
,
y
)
∧
(
y
=
z
→
(
BOY
(
w
)
∧
x
≠
w
∧
LOVES
(
z
,
w
)
)
)
)
)
,



and to 
independence-friendly logic
, in which
(
2
) is equivalent to 


∀
x
∃
y
(
BOY
(
x
)
→
(
GIRL
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
x
,
y
)
∧
(
∃
z
/
x
)
(
BOY
(
z
)
∧
x
≠
z
∧
LOVES
(
y
,
z
)
)
)
)
.



We will not give here a detailed explanation of the semantics of these
two formalisms; suffice to say, in (
3
) the value of

w
 does not depend on the values of 
x
 and 
y
 (although it
may depend on the value of 
z
), as they belong to different
“rows” of the complex quantifier

(
∀
x
∃
y
∀
z
∃
w
)
, while in
(
4
) the value of 
z
 does not depend on the value
of 
x
, because this dependency is explicitly “slashed
away” by the quantifier (
∃
z
/
x
).



One feature common to branching quantifier logic and independence
friendly logic, as we can see, is that they do not separate the
quantification of variables from the specification of non-standard
patterns of dependence: as in the case of first order logic, whether a
quantified variable 
v
1
 will or will not depend on some other
quantified variable 
v
2
 will be determined by the respective
position and form of their quantifiers.



Dependence logic takes a different approach to the problem of
extending first order logic in order to represent
(
2
). Compared to (
1
), the only
novel condition is the one that states that the value of 
z
 is

determined
 by (that is, functionally dependent on) the value
of 
y
; and this corresponds to a new atomic condition 
=
(
y
,
z
)
, called a 
dependence atom
, whose intended meaning is
that (the value of) 
z
 is a function of the value of 
y
.
Differently from the cases of branching quantifier logic or
independence-friendly logic, this is a condition over the values that

y
 and 
z
 can take, not a condition over the behaviour of the
quantifier 
∃
z
: indeed, there is in general no reason to
require that 
z
 is a quantified variable at all—it might well
be a free variable instead, or some complex term involving multiple
variables.



In dependence logic, (
2
) can be formalized as 


∀
x
∃
y
∃
z
(
=
(
y
,
z
)
∧
(
BOY
(
x
)
→
(
GIRL
(
y
)
∧
LOVES
(
x
,
y
)
→
(
BOY
(
z
)
∧
x
≠
z
∧
LOVES
(
y
,
z
)
)
)
)
)



The truth conditions of (
2
), (
3
),
(
4
) and (
5
) are precisely the same:
any model that satisfies one of these expressions (in the respective
languages) satisfies all four. More in general, as we will see, the
expressive powers of existential second-order logic,
independence-friendly logic and dependence logic 
with respect to
definability of classes of models
 are precisely the same. This
is, however, not the case for formulas with free variables; and
furthermore, these logics can be extended and modified along markedly
different lines.


2. Team semantics



Team semantics, first developed by Wilfrid Hodges in the context of
independence friendly logic (Hodges 1997), is a generalization of
Tarski’s semantics for first order logic to the case of multiple
assignments of elements to variables. Sets of such assignments, called

teams
 for historical reasons, constitute the fundamental
semantic notion of team semantics, and formulas are satisfied or not
satisfied with respect to them rather than with respect to single
assignments. The connection between team semantics and Tarski
semantics is shown by the following result, which holds in dependence
logic as well as in all its first order variants:






Conservativity:



A first order formula is satisfied by a team 
X
 (in the sense of
team semantics) if and only if all assignments 
s
∈
X
 satisfy it
(in the sense of Tarski semantics). 





More in general, teams can be understood as 
belief sets
,
representing the set of all states of the world (=assignments) that
some agent believes possible. Then a team 
X
 will satisfy some
formula 
ϕ
 if and only if 
ϕ
 holds when 
X
 is the set
of all possible states; and in this case, we will write 
X
⊨
ϕ
 (or 
M
,
X
⊨
ϕ
 if the choice of the model 
M
 is
not clear). In this section, we will examine the rules of team
semantics and their interpretation in terms of this principle; then,
in the next section, we will discuss how it also arises from the
imperfect-information 
game-theoretic semantics
 for dependence
logic.



The condition for the new dependence atoms 
=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
, which correspond to the statement that the value of 
y
 is a
function of the values of 
x
1
…
x
n
, is easily
understood:






TS-dep:




X
⊨
 
=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
 if and only if any two
assignments 
s
1
,
s
2
∈
X
 which agree on the values of 
x
1
…
x
n
 also agree on the value of 
y
. 





For example, suppose that 
X
 is a set of assignments over the three
variables 
x
1
, 
x
2
 and 
y
, where 
x
1
 represents the
nationality of a candidate to a position, 
x
2
 represents their
score (according to a suitable evaluation method) and 
y
 represents
whether they were accepted or rejected. Then the atom 
=
(
x
2
,
y
)
 corresponds to the statement that the offer is determined by the
score alone: if two candidates have the same score they will receive
exactly the same offer, regardless of any other factor. A special case
of dependence atom is given by the 
constancy atoms


=
(
y
)
, which—as per the above semantics—are
satisfied by a team if and only if all of its assignments agree over
the value of 
y
.

Table 1:
 A team 
X
 in which 
y
=
x

. Here 
y
 is a function of 
x
1
 and 
x
2
, and hence

=
(
x
1
x
2
,
y
)
 holds; however, 
y
 is not a function of

x
1
 alone, so 
=
(
x
1
,
y
)
 does not hold.





Under the same interpretation, the rules for first-order literals and
conjunctions (for simplicity, we will assume that our expressions are
in negation normal form; and, as is customary, we will assume that the
negations of dependence atoms are never satisfied) are easy to
derive:






TS-lit:



For all first-order literals 
α
, 
X
⊨
α
 if and
only if for all assignments 
s
∈
X
, 
s
⊨
α
 in the
usual Tarski semantics sense; 




TS-
∧
:




X
⊨
ϕ
∧
ψ
 if and only if 
X
⊨
ϕ
 and

X
⊨
ψ
.





It is worth pointing out that, as we can already see by these rules,
the 
law of the excluded middle
 does not hold in dependence
logic (just as it does not hold in independence friendly logic): for
example, if a team 
X
 contains both assignments 
s
 with 
s
(
x
)
=
s
(
y
)
 and assignments 
s
′
 with 
s
′
(
x
)
≠
s
′
(
y
)
 then 
X
⊭
x
=
y
 and 
X
⊭
x
≠
y
. In this section,
in any case, we will present the language of dependence logic without
an explicit negation operator; then, later, we will discuss the
consequences of adding it to its language.



What about universal quantification? In which circumstances should a
universally quantified expression 
∀
v
ψ
 hold in a team?
Again, we must recall the intuition according to which a team
represents a set of possible states of things. If we wish to evaluate

∀
v
ψ
, with respect to which possible states of things
should we evaluate 
ψ
? The natural answer is that we should
consider all states of things that differ from ones in 
X
 only with
respect to the value of 
v
. This justifies the following rule:






TS-
∀
:




X
⊨
∀
v
ψ
 if and only if 
X
[
M
/
v
]
⊨
ϕ
,
where 
X
[
M
/
v
]
 is the set 
{
s
′
:
∃
s
∈
X
 s.t. 
s
′
∼
v
x
}
 





where 
s
′
∼
v
s
 means that the two assignments 
s
 and 
s
′

differ from each other at most with respect to the value of the
variable 
v
.

Let us now consider disjunction. When should 
ϕ
∨
ψ
 hold?
To answer this, let us recall—once again—that teams can be
understood as sets of possible states of things, and that therefore
the union of two teams 
Y
 and 
Z
 represents all states of things
which may occur if 
Y
 or 
Z
 is the case. Therefore, if the two
formulas 
ϕ
 and 
ψ
 are satisfied by the set of teams

{
Y
1
…
Y
n
,
…
}
 and 
{
Z
1
…
Z
n
,
…
}

respectively, their disjunction 
ϕ
∨
ψ
 should be satisfied
by the set of teams 
{
Y
i
∪
Z
j
:
i
,
j
∈
1
,
…
}
, or,
equivalently,






TS-
∨
:




X
⊨
ϕ
∨
ψ
 if and only if 
X
=
Y
∪
Z
 for two
teams 
Y
 and 
Z
 such that 
Y
⊨
ϕ
 and 
Z
⊨
ψ
. 





It is worth pointing out here that we do 
not
 require, in
general, that 
Y
 and 
Z
 are disjoint. Because of the

downwards closure property
, which we will discuss soon, this
additional condition would make no difference for the semantics of
dependence logic proper; but in the case of certain extensions and
variants of dependence logic, that additional requirement would
conflict with the principle of 
locality
 according to which
the satisfaction conditions of an expression depend only on the values
of the variables which occur free in it (Galliani 2012).



It is also important to note that, in dependence logic, disjunction is

not
 idempotent: for example, 
=
(
x
,
y
)
∨
=
(
x
,
y
)

is not equivalent to 
=
(
x
,
y
)
, and it is satisfied by a team

X
 if and only if for every 
three
 assignments in 
X

which agree on 
x
 at least 
two
 agree on 
y
. This may
appear somewhat counter-intuitive; but it is a straightforward
consequence of the fact that, under our interpretation, 
=
(
x
,
y
)
∨
=
(
x
,
y
)
 is to be read as “every possible state of
things comes from one of two sets of states of things, and in both of
them 
y
 is a function of 
x
”. Since the union of functions
is not in general a function, it comes to little surprise that
disjunction in dependence logic is not idempotent.



Finally, we consider the case of existential quantification. When is
the expression 
∃
v
ψ
 satisfied by a team? In order to
answer this, we may begin by considering the interpretation of the

restriction
 operator which, given any team 
X
, results in
the team 
X
∖
v
 obtained by removing the variable 
v

(if present) from all assignments 
s
∈
X
 (and then, since 
X

is a set, by collapsing identical assignments). This could be
understood as a 
forgetting
 operation, through which we delete
all information about the value of 
v
—for example, because
what we believed about this value was unreliable, or because this
value has been altered. Now suppose that 
X
∖
v
=
Y
∖
v
: then, in our interpretation, this means that the
sets of possible states of things represented by 
X
 and 
Y

disagree at most with respect to the value of 
v
. Thus, if 
Y

satisfies the condition 
ϕ
, we may say that 
X
 would satisfy

ϕ
 
if not for the value of
 
y
, or, equivalently,
that 
X
 satisfies 
∃
v
ψ
. This justifies the following
rule:






TS-
∃
:




X
⊨
∃
v
ψ
 if and only if there exists some 
Y
,
over the variables of 
X
 and 
v
, such that 
X
∖
v
=
Y
∖
v
 and 
Y
⊨
ψ
. 





It is straightforward to verify that this is the case if and only if

Y
 is of the form 
X
[
F
/
y
]
=
{
s
[
a
/
y
]
:
s
∈
X
,
a
∈
F
(
s
)
}
 for
some function 
F
 from assignments in 
X
 to nonempty sets of
elements of our model.



It is worth pointing out here that it is not in general required by
the above definition that 
X

variable occurring in the assignments of

—a single
assignment in

 may also correspond to multiple assignments in

We will postpone an in-depth discussion of the properties of
dependence logic to after the specification of its game-theoretic
semantics. However, we conclude this section with the following three
important consequences of the above-given rules:






Locality:



If the restrictions of 
X
 and 
Y
 to the variables occurring free
in 
ϕ
 are the same then 
X
⊨
ϕ
 if and only if 
Y
⊨
ϕ
. 




Downwards closure:



If 
X
⊨
ϕ
 and 
Y
⊆
X
 then 
Y
⊨
ϕ
.





Empty set property:



If 
∅
 is the team containing no assignments then

∅
⊨
ϕ
 for all dependence logic formulas 
ϕ
.






The locality principle, together with the conservativity principle
mentioned at the beginning of this section, constitutes an important
“sanity condition” that any variant and extension of
dependence logic should satisfy. The same cannot be said about
downwards closure and the empty set property, which—as we will
see—are violated by variants of dependence logic.



Finally, we need to define the 
truth
 of a dependence logic
sentence with respect to a model. Since a sentence has no free
variables, by the locality principle we have at once that either all
nonempty teams satisfy it or no nonempty team satisfies it. This is
analogous to the case of Tarski’s semantics, in which a sentence
is either satisfied by all variable assignments or by none of them.
Thus, we can define truth in the usual way:






Truth in team semantics:



A sentence 
ϕ
 is true in a model 
M
 if and only if 
M
,
{
∅
}
⊨
ϕ
, where 
{
∅
}
 is the team
containing only the empty assignment. In this case, we write that 
M
⊨
ϕ
. 




2.1 Game-theoretic semantics



As mentioned, the game-theoretic semantics for dependence logic is a
variant of the imperfect-information semantics for
independence-friendly logic, which is itself an adaptation of the
game-theoretic semantics of first-order logic. We refer the reader to
(Väänänen 2007a) for a formal, detailed definition of
this semantics.



In game-theoretic semantics, a sentence 
ϕ
 and a model 
M
 are
made to correspond to a (usually two-player) game 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
. Then
truth is defined in terms of the existence of 
winning
strategies
 for one of the players (who, in this work, will be
called simply “Player 
0
”): in other words, if

σ
0
 is a (possibly non-deterministic) strategy for Player

0
 and 
Π
(
G
M
(
ϕ
)
,
σ
0
)
 is the set of all plays which
are compatible with 
σ
0
 then 
ϕ
 is true if and only if
every play in 
Π
(
G
M
(
ϕ
)
,
σ
0
)
 is winning for Player

0
. It is possible to think of the game 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
 as a debate
between two players, one of whom (Player 
0
) wishes to demonstrate
that it is the case that 
ϕ
 while the other (Player 
1
)
wishes to demonstrate that it is not the case that 
ϕ
.



As in the case of first-order logic and independence-friendly logic,
in the imperfect-information game for dependence logic the positions
of the game are pairs 
(
θ
,
s
)
, where 
θ
 is an instance
of a subformula of 
ϕ
 (that is, multiple occurrences of the same
expression as a subformula of 
ϕ
 are to be considered
separately) and 
s
 is a variable assignment over the model
 
M
.
[
1
]

 The initial position is 
(
ϕ
,
∅
)
, where 
∅
 is
the empty assignment; and a non-deterministic strategy 
σ
0

for Player 
0
 selects, for every disjunction and existential
quantification, one or more 
successors
 of the current
position according to the following rules:







If the current position is of the form 
(
ψ
∨
θ
,
s
)
 then
its successors are 
(
ψ
,
s
)
 and 
(
θ
,
s
)
;





If the current position is of the form 
(
∃
v
ψ
,
s
)
 then
its successors are all positions 
(
ψ
,
s
′
)
 with 
s
′
∼
v
s
.





Similarly, the successors of 
(
ψ
∧
θ
,
s
)
 are 
(
ψ
,
s
)
 and 
(
θ
,
s
)
, and the successors of 
(
∀
v
ψ
,
s
)
 are all positions of the form 
(
ψ
,
s
′
)
 for 
s
′
∼
v
s
;
but a strategy for Player 
0
 cannot specify a successor for these
positions, as it is assumed that Player 
1
 chooses which position
follows them.



A sequence of positions 
¯
ρ
=
ρ
0
ρ
1
…
ρ
n
 is a 
play
 of 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
 if and only if








ρ
0
=
(
ϕ
,
∅
)
;





For all 
i
=
1
…
n
, 
ρ
i
 is a successor of

ρ
i
−
1
.





If furthermore 
ρ
i
+
1
∈
σ
0
(
ρ
i
)
 whenever 
ρ
i

corresponds to a disjunction or an existential quantifier, we say that

¯
ρ
 
respects
 the strategy 
σ
0
; and as
mentioned, we write 
Π
(
G
M
(
ϕ
)
,
σ
0
)
 for the set of all
plays over 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
 which respect 
σ
0
.



We say that a strategy 
σ
0
 is 
winning
 if every play

¯
ρ
 which ends in a position 
(
α
,
s
)
 where

α
 is a first-order literal is such that the assignment 
s

satisfies 
α
 in the usual sense of Tarski’s semantics.
Dependence atoms—and the plays which ends in dependence
atoms—are of no relevance for deciding whether a given strategy
is winning. However, they are used to specify whether a given strategy
is 
uniform
:






Uniformity condition



A strategy 
σ
0
 for 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
 is uniform if any two plays

¯
ρ
,
¯
γ
∈
Π
(
G
M
(
ϕ
)
,
σ
0
)

which end in two positions 
(
=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
,
s
)
,

(
=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
,
s
′
)
 for the same instance of the
dependence atom 
=
(
x
1
…
x
n
,
y
)
 we have that 


If 
s
(
x
1
)
…
s
(
x
n
)
=
s
′
(
x
1
)
…
s
′
(
x
n
)
 then 
s
(
y
)
=
s
′
(
y
)
.





Then we can define truth in game-theoretic semantics as follows:






Truth in game-theoretic semantics:



A sentence 
ϕ
 is true in a model 
M
 (with respect to
game-theoretic semantics) if and only if Player 
0
 has a uniform
winning strategy in 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
.





It can be shown that this notion is equivalent to the notion of truth
in team semantics. In fact, we can show more than this. If, for any
team 
X
 and formula 
ϕ
, the game 
G
M
,
X
(
ϕ
)
 is played
as 
G
M
(
ϕ
)
 but with the initial position chosen randomly for
every play from 
{
(
ϕ
,
s
)
:
s
∈
X
}
, then the following
holds:






Equivalence of GTS and team semantics:



A formula 
ϕ
 is satisfied by a team 
X
 (with respect to a
model 
M
) if and only if Player 
0
 has a uniform winning
strategy in 
G
M
,
X
(
ϕ
)
.





This result, as an aside, makes it clear why the team semantics of
dependence logic satisfies the empty set property and the downwards
closure property. Indeed, if 
X
=
∅
 then every strategy for
Player 
0
 in 
G
M
,
X
(
ϕ
)
 is trivially winning and uniform;
and if 
X
⊆
Y
 then any uniform winning strategy for Player

0
 in 
G
M
,
X
(
ϕ
)
 is also a uniform winning strategy for
Player 
0
 in 
G
M
,
Y
(
ϕ
)
.


3. Properties


3.1 Expressivity



Sentence-wise, dependence logic is equivalent to the existential
fragment 
Σ
1
1
 of second-order logic. More precisely, it can
be proved (Väänänen 2007a) that






Sentence-wise equivalence of dependence logic and

Σ
1
1
:



For every dependence logic sentence 
ϕ
 there exists a

Σ
1
1
 sentence 
ϕ
∗
 such that 


M
⊨
ϕ
⇔
M
⊨
ϕ
∗
 for all models 
M
.



Similarly, for every 
Σ
1
1
 sentence 
ϕ
∗
 there exists a
dependence logic sentence 
ϕ
 such that (
6
)
holds.





Since Fagin’s Theorem (Fagin 1974) shows that a property of
finite models is definable in 
Σ
1
1
 if and only if it is
recognizable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine
(that is, if and only if it is in NPTIME), it follows at once that






Dependence logic and NPTIME:



For any dependence logic sentence 
ϕ
, the class of all finite
models which satisfy it is in NPTIME. Furthermore,for any NPTIME class

K
 of finite models, there exists a dependence logic
sentence 
ϕ
 such that 
M
⊨
ϕ
 if and only if 
M
∈
K
.





Another direct consequence of the equivalence between dependence logic
and 
Σ
1
1
 on the level of sentences is that the compactness
theorem and the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem both hold for dependence
logic too (Väänänen 2007a):






Compactness:



If a set 
Φ
 of finite dependence logic sentences is not
satisfiable in any model then some finite subset 
Φ
0
⊆
f
Φ
 of it is already not satisfiable.




Löwenheim-Skolem theorem:



If a dependence logic sentence has an infinite model then it has
models of all infinite cardinalities.





However, matters are more delicate when it comes to formulas with free
variables. Then it is possible to show (Kontinen &
Väänänen 2009) that dependence logic corresponds to the

downwards-closed
 fragment of existential second order
logic:






Team definability in dependence logic



A set 
X
 of teams over a model 
M
 and a set 
V
 of
variables is of the form 
{
X
:
M
,
X
⊨
ϕ
}
 for some
dependence logic formula 
ϕ
, with free variables in 
V
, if
and only if








X
 is nonempty;






X
 is downwards closed, that is, 
Y
⊆
X
∈
X
⇒
Y
∈
X
;






X
 is 
Σ
1
1
-definable in 
M
, that is, there
exists a 
Σ
1
1
 
sentence
 
Ψ
(
R
)
, over the
vocabulary of 
M
 plus the new 
|
V
|
-ary relation symbol 
R
,
such that 


X
∈
X
 if and only if 
M
,
Rel
(
X
)
⊨
Ψ
(
R
)



where 
Rel
(
X
)
 is the 
|
V
|
-ary relation 
{
s
(
V
)
:
s
∈
X
}
 which corresponds to the team 
X
.






3.2 Hierarchies in dependence logic



In (Durand & Kontinen 2012), the effect of restricting the number of
dependent variables of dependence atoms or the number of universal
quantifiers was examined. It was shown that both of these ways of
defining fragments of dependence logic give rise of hierarchies:







For all 
k
, let 
D
(
k
−
∀
)
 be dependence logic
restricted to at most 
k
 universal quantifiers and let 
D
(
k
−
d
e
p
)
 be dependence logic restricted to dependency atoms of the
form 
=
(
→
x
,
y
)
 for 
|
→
x
|
≤
k
. Then 


D
(
k
−
∀
)
<
D
(
k
+
1
−
d
e
p
)
,
D
(
k
−
∀
)
≤
D
(
k
−
d
e
p
)
≤
D
(
k
+
1
−
d
e
p
)



and


D
(
k
−
∀
)
<
D
(
2
k
+
2
−
∀
)



with respect to the expressive power of sentences.




3.3 Negation in dependence logic



So far, we assumed that all dependence logic expressions are in
negation normal form, and that dependence atoms are never negated.
Adding an explicit negation operator to the language of dependence
logic, on the other hand, is somewhat problematic, owing to the fact
that existential second order logic is not closed under negation.
Indeed, the “obvious” negation rule 


X
⊨∼
ϕ
 if and only if 
X
⊭
ϕ



greatly increases the expressive power of dependence logic, extending
it to 
team logic
 (Väänänen 2007a,b), which is,
in a very strong sense, equivalent to full second order logic
(Kontinen & Nurmi 2009).



A less strong, “dual” negation 
¬
 can be defined in
terms of de Morgan’s rules, 
¬
(
ϕ
∨
[
∧
]
ψ
)
≡
(
¬
ϕ
)
∧
[
∨
]
(
¬
ψ
)
 and 
¬
(
∃
v
[
∀
v
]
ϕ
)
≡
∀
v
[
∃
v
]
(
¬
ϕ
)
, plus
the law of double negation 
¬
¬
ϕ
≡
ψ
 and the
rule 


X
⊨
¬
=
(
→
x
,
y
)
 if and only if 
X
=
∅



for negations of dependence atoms (Väänänen 2007a,b).
The resulting language is expressively equivalent to negation-free
dependence logic, and, in fact, the description of dependence logic of
(Väänänen 2007a) considers this negation as part of its
language; however, as shown in (Kontinen & Väänänen
2011), the satisfaction conditions of a dependence logic formula and
those of its negation have little connection to one another. More
precisely:






Dual negation and dependence logic:



For any two dependence logic formulas 
ϕ
 and 
ψ
 such that

ϕ
∧
ψ
 is not satisfiable, there exists a dependence
logic formula 
θ
 such that 


M
,
X
⊨
θ
 if and only if 
M
,
X
⊨
ϕ



and


M
,
X
⊨
¬
θ
 if and only if 
M
,
X
⊨
ψ



for all models 
M
 and teams 
X
.





Thus, nothing in general can be said about the dual negation of

ϕ
 except that it is equivalent to some dependence logic
expression which is not satisfied by any team which satisfies

ϕ
. Since, as already mentioned, the law of the excluded middle
fails in dependence logic, this is not a very informative property; in
particular, it is possible to find in dependence logic (with dual
negation) equivalent expressions with non-equivalent negations, like
for example 
x
≠
x
∧
y
≠
y
 and

¬
=
(
x
,
y
)
.


3.4 Truth, validity and proof systems in dependence logic



Like independence friendly logic, dependence logic can define its own
truth operator (Väänänen 2007a), that is, if for all
formulas 
ϕ
 we have that 
⌈
ϕ
⌉
 is the Gödel
number of 
ϕ
 then we can find a formula 
τ
(
x
)
, with 
x

as its only free variable, such that 


M
⊨
ϕ
 if and only if 
M
⊨
τ
(
⌈
ϕ
⌉
)



for all models 
M
 which satisfy Peano’s axioms for natural
numbers. This is not in contradiction with Tarski’s
undefinability theorem, because dependence logic is not closed under
contradictory negation.



The problem of deciding whether a dependence logic sentence is valid
(that is, true in all models) is non-arithmetical, and in fact
complete with respect to the 
Π
2
 class of the Levy hierarchy.
Nonetheless, the proof theory of dependence logic has been studied. In
particular, in (Kontinen & Väänänen 2013), a sound
and complete proof system has been developed for the problem of
finding the 
first order
 consequences of a dependence logic
theory.


4. Variants of dependence logic



In this section, we will briefly summarize the properties of the most
studied variants of dependence logic. Many such variants exist, and
much work has been done on their classification and comparison. In
this work, we will only mention those variants which are of special
significance because of their relationship with dependence logic
proper.


4.1 Independence Logic



Rather than extending first order logic with dependence atoms

=
(
→
x
,
y
)
, independence logic (Grädel &
Väänänen 2013) extends it with 
independence
atoms
 
→
x
⊥
→
z
→
y
, whose intended
interpretation is “for any possible choice of 
→
z
, the
possible values of 
→
x
 and 
→
y
 are
independent”—in other words, given any fixed choice of

→
z
, knowing the value taken by 
→
x
 would not convey any
information about the value taken by 
→
y
. This is a notion of
significant conceptual importance: for example, one may want to
express that—if one does not know the encryption
key—seeing the encrypted version of a message carries no
information about the corresponding clear-text version. If 
x

represents the encrypted message and 
y
 represents the plain-text
one, then this corresponds to the condition 
x
⊥
y
,
where 
→
z
 in this case is empty. Similarly, if 
k
 represents
the key then 
x
⊥
k
 represents the claim that the key
cannot be inferred from the encrypted message; and the conjunction
dependence atom 
=
(
k
,
x
,
y
)
 (which, as we will soon see, can
be represented in independence logic) represents the claim that the
plain-text message can be decoded given the encrypted message and the
key.



Formally, the satisfaction rule for independence atoms can be given as
follows:






TS-indep:




M
⊨
X
→
x
⊥
→
z
→
y
 if and only if
for all 
s
,
s
′
∈
X
 with 
s
(
→
z
)
=
s
′
(
→
z
)
 there exists a

s
″
∈
X
 with 
s
″
(
→
z
→
x
)
=
s
(
→
x
→
z
)
 and

s
″
(
→
y
)
=
s
′
(
→
y
)
.

Independence logic is strictly more expressive than dependence logic:
indeed, it lacks the downwards closure property, and the dependence
atom 
=
(
→
x
,
y
)
 is equivalent to the independence atom 
y
⊥
→
x
y
. Furthermore, it can also be shown
(Galliani & Väänänen 2014) that conditioned
independence atoms 
→
x
⊥
→
y
→
z
 can be
defined in terms of 
unconditional
 independence atoms 
→
x
⊥
→
y
.



Sentence-wise, independence logic is also equivalent to existential
second order logic 
Σ
1
1
; but formula-wise, it is more
expressive, and it was shown in Galliani 2012 that it can capture all
nonempty 
Σ
1
1
-definable team properties.


4.2 Inclusion logic



Inclusion logic (Galliani 2012, Galliani & Hella 2013) extends
first-order logic with 
inclusion atoms
 
→
x
⊆
→
y
, reminiscent of the inclusion dependencies of database
theory. Its semantics is:






TS-inc:




M
⊨
X
→
x
⊆
→
y
 if and only if for all 
s
∈
X
 there exists a 
s
′
∈
X
 such that 
s
(
→
x
)
=
s
′
(
→
y
)
.

Differently from dependence and independence logic, inclusion logic is
(sentence-wise) strictly weaker than existential second order logic.
In fact, it can be shown (Galliani & Hella 2013) to be equivalent
to the positive fragment of 
greatest fixed point logic
, and,
therefore, to capture PTIME properties of models over finite ordered
models. Formula-wise, inclusion logic is strictly weaker than
independence logic but incomparable with dependence logic: indeed, the
satisfiability conditions of its formulas are not downwards closed,
but they are 
closed by unions
 in the sense that 


M
,
X
i
⊨
ϕ
∀
i
∈
I
⇒
M
,
⋃
i
X
i
⊨
ϕ
.


4.3 Team Logic



Team logic (Väänänen 2007a,b; Kontinen & Nurmi
2009) extends dependence logic by adding to it a 
contradictory
negation
 
¬
. It is equi-expressive with full second order
logic, both in terms of definability of classes of models
(Väänänen 2007b) and with respect to the classes of teams that team logic
expressions can define with respect to a given model (Kontinen &
Nurmi 2009). In (Lück 2019), a Hilbert-style axiomatization for Team Logic (and for its modal and propositional equivalents) was found that is complete for its dependence-free fragment (that is, for the fragment in which dependence atoms do not appear).


4.4 Intuitionistic Dependence Logic



Intuitionistic dependence logic (Abramsky &
Väänänen 2009; Yang 2013) extends dependence logic by
adding an implication connective 
ϕ
→
ψ
, whose
satisfaction rules are given in team semantics by






TS-
→
:




X
⊨
ϕ
→
ψ
 if and only if for all subsets

Y
 of 
X
, if 
Y
⊨
ϕ
 then 
Y
⊨
ψ
.





This operator is called the “intuitionistic implication”,
because of the similarity between its semantics and the one of the
implication operator in Kripke’s semantics for intuitionistic
logic (Kripke 1965). Its interpretation in terms of belief is quite
straightforward: if the assignments in 
X
 represent the 
states
of thing
 that some agent believes possible, then a subset 
Y

of 
X
 may represent the result of a 
belief update
 in which
the agent rejects some previously believed possible states of thing,
and 
ϕ
→
ψ
 states than any such update that would
cause 
ϕ
 to hold would also cause 
ψ
 to hold. From this
standpoint, this is a very natural concept which permits us to
describe predictions about how such an agent’s overall belief
state would react to belief updates.



However, because of the second order universal quantification implicit
in its semantics, this connective suffices to greatly increase the
expressive complexity of the logic: in particular, as shown in (Yang
2013), any sentence of second order logic is equivalent to some
sentence of intuitionistic dependence logic. Intuitionistic dependence
logic retains the downwards closure property: if a team satisfies an
intuitionistic dependence logic formula then so do all of its
subsets.


4.5 Generalized Dependencies and Connectives in Team Semantics



The variants and extensions of Dependence Logic seen above are all
generated from First Order Logic (with Team Semantics) by introducing
new atoms or connectives. It is possible to consider 
generalized
dependence atoms
 (Kuusisto 2015), much in the same way in which
generalized quantifiers are introduced in classical First Order Logic,
and ask questions like:




For which collections 
D
 of atoms or connectives is it
the case that 
F
O
(
D
)
 (i.e., First Order Logic
augmented by the atoms and connectives in 
D
) is
expressively equivalent to First Order Logic? Such collections

D
 are said to be 
strongly first order
.


Given a collection 
D
 of atoms and connectives, for
which other collections 
E
 of atoms and connectives is it
the case that 
F
O
(
D
,
E
)
 is expressively
equivalent to 
F
O
(
D
)
? Such 
E
 are
said to be 
safe
 for 
D
.





No complete answer to these questions is known at the moment. Some
partial results, however, are known:




If 
D
 is a collection of upwards closed dependencies
(that is to say, dependencies that, if true of some team 
X
 in some
model 
M
, are also true of any superteam 
Y
⊇
X
 in the
same model), plus possibly the constancy atom (that is, the
already-mentioned special case of the dependence atom that states that
some variable is constant over a team), then 
D
 is
strongly first order (Galliani 2015);


Not all strongly first order dependencies are safe for all
dependencies: in particular, the constancy atom is not safe for

unary
 inclusion dependencies 
x
⊆
y
, where 
x

and 
y
 are single variables; the possibility operator 
⋄
ϕ
, which is satisfied by a team 
X
 in a model 
M
 if and
only if there is a nonempty subset of X that satisfies 
ϕ
 in

M
, is instead safe for all collections of dependencies, as are the
totality atom (that states that some variable, or tuple of variables,
takes all possible values) and the non-constancy atom (that states
that some variable takes at least two different values in a team)
(Galliani forthcoming);


If 
D
 is a strongly first order collection of
dependencies and 
E
 is a collection of downwards closed
dependencies (that is, dependencies that whenever true of some team
they are also true of every subteam), then 
D
 is safe for

E
 (Galliani 2019); 


If 
D
 is a collection of dependencies that are
downwards closed and 
relativizable
 (that is to say, adding
relativizations of dependencies in 
D
 to unary predicates

P
 to the language is no more expressive than adding the
dependencies themselves), then 
D
 is strongly first order
if and only if every dependence in it can be defined in terms of
constancy atoms (Galliani 2019). 





These are all partial results, however, and the general theory of
dependencies and connectives in Team Semantics is still in its
infancy.


 
A related topic is the study of extensions of Dependence Logic via
generalized quantifiers (Engström 2012). An interesting result
along these lines consists in axiomatization for the extension of
Dependence Logic via the quantifier 
Q
 “there exist
uncountably many…”, which is sound and complete for the

FO
(
Q
)
 consequences of a theory (Engström, Kontinen
& Väänänen 2017).


 
Also worth pointing out in this context is the work of (Kontinen
& Yang 2019), which found a logic based on Team Semantics (with
different choices of connectives than the “standard” ones
of Dependence Logic) whose formulas capture precisely the
first-order-definable properties of teams.


4.6 Propositional Dependence Logic



The dependence and independence atoms considered so far express
relationships between the possible values of 
variables
 in a
set of assignments. However, the same notions of dependence and
independence can be equally naturally be applied to proposition
themselves, as it happens in natural language expression such as for
instance “Whether he will or will not pass the course depends
only on the content of his final exam”.



Propositional Dependence Logic consider such atoms within the context
of propositional logic. Propositional dependence logic teams are sets
of 
valuations
 
v
 from propositional atoms 
p
1
…
p
n
 to 
{
T
,
F
}
. Its semantic rules – and their
justifications – mirror very closely the ones of first order
team semantics, and the rule for dependence atoms is






PTS-dep:




X
⊨
=
(
p
1
…
p
n
,
q
)
 if and only if any two
valuations 
v
1
,
v
2
∈
X
 which agree on the values of 
p
1
…
p
n
 also agree on the value of 
q
.





Many of the variants and generalizations of first order dependence
logic can be lowered to the propositional level without any
difficulty: thus, for example, it is possible to study the properties
of propositional inclusion logic, propositional team logic,
propositional intuitionistic dependence logic and so on.



Whereas (first order) dependence logic is strictly more expressive
than first order logic, propositional dependence logic is not more
expressive than propositional logic, as it follows immediately from
the fact that all propositional functions are expressible in
propositional logic. There exists, however, a close relation between
the teams of propositional dependence logic and the 
information
states
 of 
inquisitive logic
 (Groenendijk 2009; Ciardelli
& Roelofsen 2011), a semantic framework for the study of the
notion of meaning and information exchange: in particular, the
implication of inquisitive logic is exactly the same as the one of
propositional intuitionistic dependence logic.



Axiomatizations for propositional dependence logic and many of its
extensions can be found in (Yang & Väänänen 2016);
and the analysis of the computational complexity of this formalism
(and of related propositional logics based on Team Semantics) can be
found in (Virtema 2017; Hannula et al. 2018).


4.7 Modal Dependence Logic



Modal dependence logic (Väänänen 2008) and its variants
extend modal logic by adding to it the same dependence atoms

=
(
p
1
…
p
n
,
q
)
 already considered in the case of
propositional dependence logic.



Its satisfaction conditions can be defined through a variant of team
semantics in which teams are replaced by 
sets
 of possible
worlds.



Much research has investigated the complexity-theoretic properties of
this logic, of its fragments, and its extensions (Ebbing, Lohmann,
& Yang 2011; Ebbing & Lohmann 2012; Lohmann & Vollmer
2013).



Modal Independence Logic has also been investigated in (Kontinen et al, 2017). 



4.8 Linear Temporal Logic with Team Semantics



Linear Temporal Logic may also be given a “Team Semantics”
of sorts, in which formulas are evaluated with respect to sets of
traces (that is to say, sets of sequences of states), representing
possible computations of a system. Such a logical framework can be
used for the specification and verification of

hyperproperties
 (Krebs et al. 2017, Other Internet Resources;
Lück 2020), that is to say, properties like “The system
terminates within a bounded amount of time” whose truth cannot
be ascertained by checking every possible trace of the system on its
own but only by looking at the set of all possible traces as a whole.


4.9 Quantitative Variants of Team Semantics and Dependence Logic



As teams correspond to sets of assignments, it is natural to consider
the possibility of extensions of team semantics in which satisfaction
is defined instead with respect to 
multiteams
 (i.e.,
multisets of assignments) or 
probability distributions
 over
assignments.



The first possibility has been studied in (Durand et al. 2018a), while
the second has been studied in (Durand et al. 2018b). The second work,
in particular, has led to interesting connections to problems of
descriptive complexity over the reals and metafinite model theory
(Hannula et al. 2019, Hannula et al. 2020). 




5. Applications of dependence logic


5.1 Dependence logic and database theory



There is a straightforward connection between the teams of team
semantics and the relations studied in relational database theory:
given a team 
X
 and a tuple of variables 
→
v
=
v
1
…
v
k
 occurring in its assignments, it is possible to define the
relation 
X
(
→
v
)
=
{
⟨
s
(
v
1
)
,
…
,
s
(
v
n
)
⟩
:
s
∈
X
}
. Furthermore, the dependency atoms studied in dependence logic
and its variants are analogous to – and in many cases, derived
from – dependencies considered in database theory such as

functional dependencies
 (Väänänen 2007a),

multivalued dependencies
 (Engström 2012), and

inclusion and exclusion dependencies
 (Galliani 2012). The
relationship between dependence logic and database theory contributed
not only to the further development of dependence logic, but also to
that of database theory: for instance, in Hannula & Kontinen 2016
a finite axiomatization of the unrestricted implication problem for
inclusion, functional, and embedded multivalued database-theoretic
dependencies was found through the study of a similar problem within
the context of team semantics.


5.2 Dependence logic and belief representation



As discussed in (Yang 2014) and (Yang & Väänänen 2016),
there exists a close connection between (propositional) intuitionistic
dependence logic and 
inquisitive logic
 (Ciardelli &
Roelofsen, 2011), a framework for the study of meaning and information
exchange between agents. More in general, the dependency atoms and
connectives of studied in team semantics admit natural interpretations
in terms of 
belief states
 and 
belief updates
, as
discussed in (Galliani 2015). At this time, the exact nature of the
relationship between such logics and dynamic-epistemic logic and its
variants (Van Ditmarsch, van Der Hoek, & Kooi 2007) is largely
unexplored, but there is ample reason to suspect further connections
between these two areas of mathematical and philosophical logic.


5.3 Dependence logic and Arrow’s theorem



Arrow’s theorem (Arrow 1950) is a profoundly influential result
of social choice theory that, in brief, shows that no voting system
(that is, no system for converting rankings of individual preferences
between alternatives into a global, societal-level preference ranking)
exists that can satisfy three reasonable-sounding conditions,
namely







If every voter prefers 
A
 to 
B
, the group as a whole prefers

A
 and 
B
;





Whether the group as a whole prefers 
A
 to 
B
 or vice versa
depends exclusively on every voter’s preferences concerning

A
 and 
B
, and 
not
 on their preferences concerning
other possible alternatives;





No single voter is a 
dictator
, that is, the group’s
preferences are not determined by the preferences of any single
voter.





As the wording itself suggests, the second and third conditions admit
a natural reading in terms of dependence and independence: in fact, as
shown in Pacuit & Yang 2016, Arrow’s theorem can be
formalized in independence logic and proved in a suitable natural
deduction system.


5.4 Quantum team logic and Bell’s inequalities



In (Hyttinen, Paolini, & Väänänen 2015) a variant of
propositional team logic, called 
quantum team logic
, is
introduced. In this formalism, teams are replaced by 
quantum
teams
, which differ from the ordinary teams of propositional team
logic in that they allow for the values of certain variables to be

indeterminate
 with respect to certain valuations and in that
they allow for multiple instances of the same valuation (thus adding a
quantitative aspect to team semantics). A semantics is then defined
over quantum teams for a language that allows for the specification of

inequalities
 concerning the probabilities of events, and a
sound and complete proof system is developed for it; and finally, it
is shown that 
Bell’s inequalities
 admit counterexamples
in this systems, as they do according to the predictions of quantum
mechanics and according to experimental evidence (Einstein, Podolsky,
& Rosen 1935; Bell 1964; Aspect, Grangier, & Roger 1981),
while they do not so in the 
classical
 version of this
framework.
