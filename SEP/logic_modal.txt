Modal Logic
First published Tue Feb 29, 2000; substantive revision Mon Jan 23, 2023





A modal is an expression (like ‘necessarily’ or
‘possibly’) that is used to qualify the truth of a
judgement. Modal logic is, strictly speaking, the study of the
deductive behavior of the expressions ‘it is necessary
that’ and ‘it is possible that’. However, the term
‘modal logic’ may be used more broadly for a family of
related systems. These include logics for belief, for tense and other
temporal expressions, for the deontic (moral) expressions such as
‘it is obligatory that’ and ‘it is permitted
that’, and many others. An understanding of modal logic is
particularly valuable in the formal analysis of philosophical
argument, where expressions from the modal family are both common and
confusing. Modal logic also has important applications in computer
science.

1. What is Modal Logic?



Narrowly construed, modal logic studies reasoning that involves the
use of the expressions ‘necessarily’ and
‘possibly’. However, the term ‘modal logic’ is
used more broadly to cover a family of logics with similar rules and a
variety of different symbols.



A list describing the best known of these logics follows.

2. Modal Logics



The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a
weak logic called 
K
 (after Saul Kripke). Under the narrow
reading, modal logic concerns necessity and possibility. A variety of
different systems may be developed for such logics using 
K
 as a
foundation. The symbols of 
K
 include ‘
∼
’
for ‘not’, ‘
→
’ for
‘if…then’, and ‘
◻
’ for the modal
operator ‘it is necessary that’. (The connectives
‘
&
’, ‘
∨
’, and
‘
↔
’ may be defined from
‘
∼
’ and ‘
→
’ as is done
in propositional logic.) 
K
 results from adding the following to
the principles of propositional logic. 



Necessitation Rule:   If 
A
 is a theorem of 
K
, then
so is 
◻
A
.



Distribution Axiom: 
◻
(
A
→
B
)
→
(
◻
A
→
◻
B
)
.



(In these principles we use ‘
A
’ and
‘
B
’ as metavariables ranging over formulas of the
language.) According to the Necessitation Rule, any theorem of logic
is necessary. The Distribution Axiom says that if it is necessary that
if 
A
 then 
B
, then if necessarily 
A
, then necessarily

B
.



The operator 
◊
 (for ‘possibly’) can be defined
from 
◻
 by letting 
◊
A
=
∼
◻
∼
A
. In

K
, the operators 
◻
 and 
◊
 behave very much like
the quantifiers 
∀
 (all) and 
∃
 (some). For example,
the definition of 
◊
 from 
◻
 mirrors the equivalence
of 
∀
x
A
 with 
∼
∃
x
∼
A
 in predicate logic.
Furthermore, 
◻
(
A
&
B
)
 entails 
◻
A
&
◻
B
 and
vice versa; while 
◻
A
∨
◻
B
 entails 
◻
(
A
∨
B
)
,
but 
not
 vice versa. This reflects the patterns exhibited by
the universal quantifier: 
∀
x
(
A
&
B
)
 entails 
∀
x
A
&
∀
x
B
 and vice versa, while 
∀
x
A
∨
∀
x
B

entails 
∀
x
(
A
∨
B
)
 but not vice versa. Similar parallels
between 
◊
 and 
∃
 can be drawn. The basis for this
correspondence between the modal operators and the quantifiers will
emerge more clearly in the section on
 
Possible Worlds Semantics
.



The system 
K
 is too weak to provide an adequate account of
necessity. The following axiom is not provable in 
K
, but it is
clearly desirable.


◻
A
→
A




(
M
)
 claims that whatever is necessary is the case. Notice that

(
M
)
 would be incorrect were 
◻
 to be read ‘it ought to
be that’, or ‘it was the case that’. So the presence
of axiom 
(
M
)
 distinguishes logics for necessity from other logics
in the modal family. A basic modal logic 
M
 results from adding

(
M
)
 to 
K
. (Some authors call this system

T
.)



Many logicians believe that 
M
 is still too weak to correctly
formalize the logic of necessity and possibility. They recommend
further axioms to govern the iteration or repetition of modal
operators. Here are two of the most famous iteration axioms:


◻
A
→
◻
◻
A


◊
A
→
◻
◊
A




S
4
 is the system that results from adding (4) to 
M
.
Similarly 
S
5
 is 
M
 plus (5). In 
S
4
, the
sentence 
◻
◻
A
 is equivalent to 
◻
A
. As a result, any
string of boxes may be replaced by a single box, and the same goes for
strings of diamonds. This amounts to the idea that iteration of the
same modal operator is superfluous. Saying that 
A
 is necessarily
necessary is considered a uselessly long-winded way of saying that

A
 is necessary. The system 
S
5
 has even stronger
principles for simplifying strings of modal operators. In

S
4
, a string of operators of 
the same kind
 can
be replaced by that operator; in 
S
5
, strings containing
both boxes and diamonds are equivalent to the last operator in the
string. So, for example, saying that it is possible that 
A
 is
necessary is the same as saying that 
A
 is necessary. A summary of
these features of 
S
4
 and 
S
5
 follows.


◻
◻
…
◻
=
◻
 and 
◊
◊
…
◊
=
◊


00
…
◻
=
◻
 and 
00
…
◊
=
◊
,
 where each 
0
 is either 
◻
 or 
◊



One could engage in endless argument over the correctness or
incorrectness of these and other iteration principles for 
◻
 and

◊
. The controversy can be partly resolved by recognizing
that the words ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’
have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal
logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind. For this reason,
there is no one modal logic, but rather a whole family of systems
built around 
M
. The relationship between these systems is
diagrammed in
 
Section 8
,
 and their application to different uses of ‘necessarily’
and ‘possibly’ can be more deeply understood by studying
their possible world semantics in
 
Section 6
.



The system 
B
 (for the logician Brouwer) is formed by
adding axiom 
(
B
)
 to 
M
.


A
→
◻
◊
A



It is interesting to note that 
S
5
 can be formulated
equivalently by adding 
(
B
)
 to 
S
4
. The axiom 
(
B
)

raises an important point about the interpretation of modal formulas.

(
B
)
 says that if 
A
 is the case, then 
A
 is necessarily
possible. One might argue that 
(
B
)
 should always be adopted in any
modal logic, for surely if 
A
 is the case, then it is necessary
that 
A
 is possible. However, there is a problem with this claim
that can be exposed by noting that 
◊
◻
A
→
A
 is
provable from 
(
B
)
. So 
◊
◻
A
→
A
 should be
acceptable if 
(
B
)
 is. However, 
◊
◻
A
→
A

says that if 
A
 is possibly necessary, then 
A
 is the case, and
this is far from obvious. Why does 
(
B
)
 seem obvious, while one of
the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that
there is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of

A
→
◻
◊
A
. We often use the expression
‘If 
A
 then necessarily 
B
’ to express that the
conditional ‘if 
A
 then 
B
’ is necessary. This
interpretation corresponds to 
◻
(
A
→
B
)
. On other
occasions, we mean that if 
A
, then 
B
 is necessary:

A
→
◻
B
. In English, ‘necessarily’ is an
adverb, and since adverbs are usually placed near verbs, we have no
natural way to indicate whether the modal operator applies to the
whole conditional or to its consequent. For these reasons, there is a
tendency to confuse 
(
B
)
:
A
→
◻
◊
A
 with

◻
(
A
→
◊
A
)
. But 
◻
(
A
→
◊
A
)
 is not the same as 
(
B
)
, for 
◻
(
A
→
◊
A
)

is already a theorem of 
M
, and 
(
B
)
 is not. One must take
special care that our positive reaction to 
◻
(
A
→
◊
A
)
 does not infect our evaluation of 
(
B
)
. One simple
way to protect ourselves is to formulate 
B
 in an equivalent way
using the axiom 
◊
◻
A
→
A
, where these
ambiguities of scope do not arise.


3. Deontic Logics



Deontic logics introduce the primitive symbol 
O
 for ‘it is
obligatory that’, from which symbols 
P
 for ‘it is
permitted that’ and 
F
 for ‘it is forbidden that’
are defined: 
P
A
=
∼
O
∼
A
 and 
F
A
=
O
∼
A
. The
deontic analog of the modal axiom 
(
M
)
:
O
A
→
A
 is clearly
not appropriate for deontic logic. (Unfortunately, what ought to be is
not always the case.) However, a basic system 
D
 of
deontic logic can be constructed by adding the weaker axiom 
(
D
)
 to

K
.


O
A
→
P
A



Axiom 
(
D
)
 guarantees the consistency of the system of obligations
by insisting that when 
A
 is obligatory, 
A
 is permissible. A
system which obligates us to bring about 
A
, but doesn’t
permit us to do so, puts us in an inescapable bind. Although some will
argue that such conflicts of obligation are at least possible, most
deontic logicians accept 
(
D
)
.




O
(
O
A
→
A
)
 is another deontic axiom that seems desirable.
Although it is wrong to say that if 
A
 is obligatory then 
A
 is
the case 
(
O
A
→
A
)
, still, this conditional 
ought

to be the case. So some deontic logicians believe that 
D
 needs to
be supplemented with 
O
(
O
A
→
A
)
 as well.



Controversy about iteration (repetition) of operators arises again in
deontic logic. In some conceptions of obligation, 
O
O
A
 just amounts
to 
O
A
. ‘It ought to be that it ought to be’ is treated
as a sort of stuttering; the extra ‘ought’s do not add
anything new. So axioms are added to guarantee the equivalence of

O
O
A
 and 
O
A
. The more general iteration policy embodied in

S
5
 may also be adopted. However, there are conceptions of
obligation where distinction between 
O
A
 and 
O
O
A
 is preserved.
The idea is that there are genuine differences between the obligations
we 
actually
 have and the obligations we 
should

adopt. So, for example, ‘it ought to be that it ought to be that

A
’ commands adoption of some obligation which may not
actually be in place, with the result that 
O
O
A
 can be true even
when 
O
A
 is false.

deontic logic

4. Temporal Logics



In temporal logic (also known as tense logic), there are two basic
operators, 
G
 for the future, and 
H
 for the past. 
G
 is read
‘it always will be that’ and the defined operator 
F

(read ‘it will be the case that’) can be introduced by

F
A
=
∼
G
∼
A
. Similarly 
H
 is read ‘it always was
that’ and 
P
 (for ‘it was the case that’) is
defined by 
P
A
=
∼
H
∼
A
. A basic system of temporal logic
called 
K
t
 results from adopting the principles of 
K

for both 
G
 and 
H
, along with two axioms to govern the
interaction between the past and future operators:



Necessitation Rules:


If 
A
 is a theorem then so are 
G
A
 and 
H
A
. 



Distribution Axioms:



G
(
A
→
B
)
→
(
G
A
→
G
B
)
 and

H
(
A
→
B
)
→
(
H
A
→
H
B
)



Interaction Axioms:



A
→
G
P
A
 and 
A
→
H
F
A



The interaction axioms raise questions concerning asymmetries between
the past and the future. A standard intuition is that the past is
fixed, while the future is still open. The first interaction axiom

(
A
→
G
P
A
)
 conforms to this intuition in reporting that
what is the case 
(
A
)
 will at all future times be in the past

(
G
P
A
)
. However 
A
→
H
F
A
 may appear to have
unacceptably deterministic overtones, for it claims, apparently, that
what is true now 
(
A
)
 has always been such that it will occur in
the future 
(
H
F
A
)
. However, possible world semantics for temporal
logic reveals that this worry results from a simple confusion and that
the two interaction axioms are equally acceptable.



Note that the characteristic axiom of modal logic, 
(
M
)
:
◻
A
→
A
, is not acceptable for either 
H
 or 
G
, since

A
 does not follow from ‘it always was the case that

A
’, nor from ‘it always will be the case that

A
’. However, it is acceptable in a closely related temporal
logic where 
G
 is read ‘it is and always will be’, and

H
 is read ‘it is and always was’.



Depending on which assumptions one makes about the structure of time,
further axioms must be added to temporal logics. A list of axioms
commonly adopted in temporal logics follows. An account of how they
depend on the structure of time will be found in the section
 
Possible Worlds Semantics
.


G
A
→
G
G
A
 and 
H
A
→
H
H
A
G
G
A
→
G
A
 and 
H
H
A
→
H
A
G
A
→
F
A
 and 
H
A
→
P
A



It is interesting to note that certain combinations of past tense and
future tense operators may be used to express complex tenses in
English. For example, 
F
P
A
, corresponds to sentence 
A
 in the
future perfect tense (as in ‘20 seconds from now the light will
have changed’). Similarly, 
P
P
A
 expresses the past perfect
tense.

5. Conditional and Relevance Logics



The founder of modal logic, C. I. Lewis, defined a series of modal
logics which did not have 
◻
 as a primitive symbol. Lewis was
concerned to develop a logic of conditionals that was free of the so
called Paradoxes of Material Implication, namely the classical
theorems 
A
→
(
∼
A
→
B
)
 and

B
→
(
A
→
B
)
. He introduced the symbol

⥽
 for “strict implication” and developed
logics where neither 
A
⥽
(
∼
A
⥽
B
)
 nor

B
⥽
(
A
⥽
B
)
 is provable. The modern practice has
been to define 
A
⥽
B
 by 
◻
(
A
→
B
)
 and use
modal logics governing 
◻
 to obtain similar results. However,
the provability of such formulas as 
(
A
&
∼
A
)
⥽
B
 in
such logics seems at odds with concern for the paradoxes. Anderson and
Belnap (1975) have developed systems 
R
 (for Relevance
Logic) and 
E
 (for Entailment) which are designed to
overcome such difficulties. These systems require revision of the
standard systems of propositional logic. (See Mares (2004) and the
entry on
 
relevance logic
.)



David Lewis (1973), Robert Stalnaker (1968), and others have developed
 
conditional logics

 to handle counterfactual expressions, that is, expressions of the
form ‘if 
A
 
were
 to happen then 
B
 
would

happen’. (Kvart (1980) is another good source on the topic.)
Counterfactual logics differ from those based on strict implication
because the former reject while the latter accept contraposition.


6. Possible Worlds Semantics



The purpose of logic is to characterize the difference between valid
and invalid arguments. A logical system for a language is a set of
axioms and rules designed to prove 
exactly
 the valid
arguments statable in the language. Creating such a logic may be a
difficult task. The logician must make sure that the system is

sound
, i.e. that every argument proven using the rules and
axioms is in fact valid. Furthermore, the system should be

complete
, meaning that every valid argument has a proof in
the system. Demonstrating soundness and completeness of formal systems
is one of a logician’s central concern. 



Such a demonstration cannot get underway until the concept of validity
is defined rigorously. Formal semantics for a logic provides a
definition of validity by characterizing the truth behavior of the
sentences of the system. In propositional logic, validity can be
defined using truth tables. A valid argument is simply one where every
truth table row that makes its premises true also makes its conclusion
true. However, truth tables cannot be used to provide an account of
validity in modal logics because there are no truth tables for
expressions such as ‘it is necessary that’, ‘it is
obligatory that’, and the like. (The problem is that the truth
value of 
A
 does not determine the truth value for 
◻
A
. For
example, when 
A
 is ‘Dogs are dogs’, 
◻
A
 is
true, but when 
A
 is ‘Dogs are pets’, 
◻
A
 is
false.) Nevertheless, semantics for modal logics can be defined by
introducing possible worlds. We will illustrate possible worlds
semantics for a logic of necessity containing the symbols 
∼
,
→
, and 
◻
. Then we will explain how the same
strategy may be adapted to other logics in the modal family.



In propositional logic, a valuation of the atomic sentences (or row of
a truth table) assigns a truth value 
(
T
 or 
F
)
 to each
propositional variable 
p
. Then the truth values of the complex
sentences are calculated with truth tables. In modal semantics, a set

W
 of possible worlds is introduced. A valuation then gives a truth
value to each propositional variable 
for each of the possible
worlds
 in 
W
. This means the value assigned to 
p
 for world

w
 may differ from the value assigned to 
p
 for another world

w
′
.



The truth value of the atomic sentence 
p
 at world 
w
 given by
the valuation 
v
 may be written 
v
(
p
,
w
)
. Given this notation,
the truth values 
(
T
 for true, 
F
 for false) of complex
sentences of modal logic for a given valuation 
v
 (and member 
w

of the set of worlds 
W
)
 may be defined by the following truth
clauses. (‘iff’ abbreviates ‘if and only
if’.)


v
(
∼
A
,
w
)
=
T
 iff 
v
(
A
,
w
)
=
F
.


v
(
A
→
B
,
w
)
=
T
 iff 
v
(
A
,
w
)
=
F
 or 
v
(
B
,
w
)
=
T
.


v
(
◻
A
,
w
)
=
T
 iff for every world 
w
′
 in 
W
,
v
(
A
,
w
′
)
=
T
.



Clauses 
(
∼
)
 and 
(
→
)
 simply describe the
standard truth table behavior for negation and material implication
respectively. According to (5), 
◻
A
 is true (at a world 
w
)

exactly when 
A
 is true in 
all
 possible worlds. Given the
definition of 
◊
 (namely 
◊
A
=
∼
◻
∼
A
)
, the truth condition (5) insures that 
◊
A
 is true just in case 
A
 is true in 
some
 possible
world. Since the truth clauses for 
◻
 and 
◊
 involve
the quantifiers ‘all’ and ‘some’
(respectively), the parallels in logical behavior between 
◻
 and

∀
x
 and between 
◊
 and 
∃
x
 noted in
Section 2 will be expected.



Clauses 
(
∼
)
,
(
→
)
, and (5) allow us to calculate the
truth value of any sentence at any world on a given valuation. A
definition of validity is now just around the corner. An argument is

5-valid for a given set W
 (of possible worlds) if and only if
every valuation of the atomic sentences that assigns the premises

T
 at a world in 
W
 also assigns the conclusion 
T
 at the
same world. An argument is said to be 
5-valid
 iff it is valid
for every non-empty set 
W
 of possible worlds.



It has been shown that 
S
5
 is sound and complete for
5-validity (hence our use of the symbol ‘5’). The 5-valid
arguments are exactly the arguments provable in 
S
5
. This
result suggests that 
S
5
 is the correct way to formulate a
logic of necessity.



However, 
S
5
 is not a reasonable logic for all members of
the modal family. In deontic logic, temporal logic, and others, the
analog of the truth condition (5) is clearly not appropriate;
furthermore there are even conceptions of necessity where (5) should
be rejected as well. The point is easiest to see in the case of
temporal logic. Here, the members of 
W
 are moments of time, or
worlds “frozen”, as it were, at an instant. For simplicity
let us consider a 
future
 temporal logic, a logic where 
◻
A
 reads: ‘it 
will
 always be the case that’. (We
formulate the system using 
◻
 rather than the traditional 
G

so that the connections with other modal logics will be easier to
appreciate.) The correct clause for 
◻
 should say that 
◻
A
 is true at time 
w
 iff 
A
 is true at all times 
in the
future of
 
w
. To restrict attention to the future, the
relation 
R
 (for ‘earlier than’) needs to be
introduced. Then the correct clause can be formulated as follows.


v
(
◻
A
,
w
)
=
T
 iff for every 
w
′
,
 if 
w
R
w
′
,
 then 
v
(
A
,
w
′
)
=
T
.



This says that 
◻
A
 is true at 
w
 just in case 
A
 is true
at all times 
after
 
w
.



Validity for this brand of temporal logic can now be defined. A

frame
 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is a pair consisting of a
non-empty set 
W
 (of worlds) and a binary relation 
R
 on 
W
.
A 
model
 
⟨
F
,
v
⟩
 consists of a frame 
F
 and
a valuation 
v
 that assigns truth values to each atomic sentence at
each world in 
W
. Given a model, the values of all complex
sentences can be determined using 
(
∼
)
,
(
→
)
, and

(
K
)
. An argument is 
K
-valid just in case any model whose
valuation assigns the premises 
T
 at a world also assigns the
conclusion 
T
 at the same world. As the reader may have guessed
from our use of ‘
K
’, it has been shown that the
simplest modal logic 
K
 is both sound and complete for

K
-validity.


7. Modal Axioms and Conditions on Frames



One might assume from this discussion that 
K
 is the correct
logic when 
◻
 is read ‘it will always be the case
that’. However, there are reasons for thinking that 
K
 is
too weak. One obvious logical feature of the relation 
R
 (earlier
than) is transitivity. If 
w
R
v
 (
w
 is earlier than 
v
)
 and

v
R
u
 (
v
 is earlier than 
u
)
, then it follows that 
w
R
u

(
w
 is earlier than 
u
)
. So let us define a new kind of validity
that corresponds to this condition on 
R
. Let a 4-model be any
model whose frame 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is such that 
R
 is a
transitive relation on 
W
. Then an argument is 4-valid iff any
4-model whose valuation assigns 
T
 to the premises at a world also
assigns 
T
 to the conclusion at the same world. We use
‘4’ to describe such a transitive model because the logic
which is adequate (both sound and complete) for 4-validity is

K
4
, the logic which results from adding the axiom (4):

◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
 to 
K
.



Transitivity is not the only property which we might want to require
of the frame 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 if 
R
 is to be read
‘earlier than’ and 
W
 is a set of moments. One
condition (which is only mildly controversial) is that there is no
last moment of time, i.e. that for every world 
w
 there is some
world 
v
 such that 
w
R
v
. This condition on frames is called

seriality.
 Seriality corresponds to the axiom 
(
D
)
:
◻
A
→
◊
A
, in the same way that transitivity
corresponds to (4). A 
D
-model is a 
K
-model with a
serial frame. From the concept of a 
D
-model the
corresponding notion of 
D
-validity can be defined just as
we did in the case of 4-validity. As you probably guessed, the system
that is adequate with respect to 
D
-validity is

K
D
, or 
K
 plus 
(
D
)
. Not only that, but the
system 
K
D
4
 (that is 
K
 plus (4) and 
(
D
)
)
 is
adequate with respect to 
D
4
-validity, where a

D
4
-model is one where 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is

both
 serial and transitive.



Another property which we might want for the relation ‘earlier
than’ is density, the condition which says that between any two
times we can always find another. Density would be false if time were
atomic, i.e. if there were intervals of time which could not be broken
down into any smaller parts. Density corresponds to the axiom 
(
C
4
)
:
◻
◻
A
→
◻
A
, the converse of (4), so for example,
the system 
K
C
4
, which is 
K
 plus 
(
C
4
)
 is
adequate with respect to models where the frame 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is dense, and 
K
D
C
4
 is adequate with respect to
models whose frames are serial and dense, and so on.



Each of the modal logic axioms we have discussed corresponds to a
condition on frames in the same way. The relationship between
conditions on frames and corresponding axioms is one of the central
topics in the study of modal logics. Once an interpretation of the
intensional operator 
◻
 has been decided on, the appropriate
conditions on 
R
 can be determined to fix the corresponding notion
of validity. This, in turn, allows us to select the right set of
axioms for that logic.



For example, consider a deontic logic, where 
◻
 is read
‘it is obligatory that’. Here the truth of 
◻
A
 does
not demand the truth of 
A
 in 
every
 possible world, but
only in a subset of those worlds where people do what they ought. So
we will want to introduce a relation 
R
 for this kind of logic as
well, and use the truth clause 
(
K
)
 to evaluate 
◻
A
 at a
world. However, in this case, 
R
 is not earlier than. Instead

w
R
w
′
 holds just in case world 
w
′
 is a morally acceptable
variant of 
w
, i.e. a world that our actions can bring about which
satisfies what is morally correct, or right, or just. Under such a
reading, it should be clear that the relevant frames should obey
seriality, the condition that requires that each possible world have a
morally acceptable variant. The analysis of the properties desired for

R
 makes it clear that a basic deontic logic can be formulated by
adding the axiom 
(
D
)
 and to 
K
.



Even in modal logic, one may wish to restrict the range of possible
worlds which are relevant in determining whether 
◻
A
 is true at
a given world. For example, I might say that it is necessary that I
pay my bills, even though I know full well that there is a possible
world where I fail to pay them. In ordinary speech, the claim that

A
 is necessary does not require the truth of 
A
 in 
all

possible worlds, but rather only in a certain class of worlds which I
have in mind (for example, worlds where I avoid penalties for failure
to pay). In order to provide a generic treatment of necessity, we must
say that 
◻
A
 is true in 
w
 iff 
A
 is true in all worlds

that are related
 to 
w
 in the right way. So for an
operator 
◻
 interpreted as necessity, we introduce a
corresponding relation 
R
 on the set of possible worlds 
W
,
traditionally called the accessibility relation. The accessibility
relation 
R
 holds between worlds 
w
 and 
w
′
 iff 
w
′
 is
possible given the facts of 
w
. Under this reading for 
R
, it
should be clear that frames for modal logic should be reflexive. It
follows that modal logics should be founded on 
M
, the system that
results from adding 
(
M
)
 to 
K
. Depending on exactly how the
accessibility relation is understood, symmetry and transitivity may
also be desired.



A list of some of the more commonly discussed conditions on frames and
their corresponding axioms along with a map showing the relationship
between the various modal logics can be found in the next section.


8. Map of the Relationships Between Modal Logics



The following diagram shows the relationships between the best known
modal logics, namely logics that can be formed by adding a selection
of the axioms 
(
D
)
,
(
M
)
, (4), 
(
B
)
 and (5) to 
K
. A list of
these (and other) axioms along with their corresponding frame
conditions can be found below the diagram.








Diagram of Modal Logics





In this chart, systems are given by the list of their axioms. So, for
example 
M
4
B
 is the result of adding 
(
M
)
, (4) and

(
B
)
 to 
K
. In boldface, we have indicated traditional names
of some systems. When system 
S
 appears below and/or to
the left of 
S
′
 connected by a line, then 
S
′

is an extension of 
S
. This means that every argument
provable in 
S
 is provable in 
S
′
, but

S
 is weaker than 
S
′
, i.e. not all arguments
provable in 
S
′
 are provable in 
S
.



The following list indicates axioms, their names, and the
corresponding conditions on the accessibility relation

The notion of correspondence between axioms and frame conditions that
is at issue here was illustrated in the previous section. The idea is
that when S is a list of axioms and F(S) is the corresponding set of
frame conditions, then S corresponds to F(S) exactly when the system
K+S is adequate (sound and complete) for F(S)-validity, that is, an
argument is provable in K+S iff it is F(S)-valid. However, a stronger
notion of the correspondence between axioms and frame conditions has
emerged in research on modal logic. (See
 
Section 14

 below.) 


9. The General Axiom



The correspondence between axioms and conditions on frames may seem
something of a mystery. A beautiful result of Lemmon and Scott (1977)
goes a long way towards explaining those relationships. Their theorem
concerned axioms which have the following form: 


◊
h
◻
i
A
→
◻
j
◊
k
A



We use the notation ‘
◊
n
’ to represent 
n

diamonds in a row, so, for example, ‘
◊
3
’
abbreviates a string of three diamonds: ‘
◊
◊
◊
’. Similarly ‘
◻
n
’ represents a
string of 
n
 boxes. When the values of 
h
,
i
,
j
, and 
k
 are
all 1, we have axiom 
(
C
)
:


◊
◻
A
→
◻
◊
A
=
◊
1
◻
1
A
→
◻
1
◊
1
A



The axiom 
(
B
)
 results from setting 
h
 and 
i
 to 0, and
letting 
j
 and 
k
 be 1:


A
→
◻
◊
A
=
◊
0
◻
0
A
→
◻
1
◊
1
A



To obtain (4), we may set 
h
 and 
k
 to 0, set 
i
 to 1 and

j
 to 2:


◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
=
◊
0
◻
1
A
→
◻
2
◊
0
A



Many (but not all) axioms of modal logic can be obtained by setting
the right values for the parameters in 
(
G
)
.



Our next task will be to give the condition on frames which
corresponds to 
(
G
)
 for a given selection of values for 
h
,
i
,
j
, and 
k
. In order to do so, we will need a definition. The
composition of two relations 
R
 and 
R
′
 is a new relation 
R
∘
R
′
 which is defined as follows:


w
R
∘
R
′
v
 iff for some 
u
,
w
R
u
 and 
u
R
′
v
.



For example, if 
R
 is the relation of being a brother and 
R
′
 is
the relation of being a parent then 
R
∘
R
′
 is the relation of
being an uncle (because 
w
 is the uncle of 
v
 iff for some
person 
u
, both 
w
 is the brother of 
u
 and 
u
 is the
parent of 
v
)
. A relation may be composed with itself. For example,
when 
R
 is the relation of being a parent, then 
R
∘
R
 is
the relation of being a grandparent, and 
R
∘
R
∘
R
 is the
relation of being a great-grandparent. It will be useful to write
‘
R
n
’, for the result of composing 
R
 with itself

n
 times. So 
R
2
 is 
R
∘
R
, and 
R
4
 is 
R
∘
R
∘
R
∘
R
. We will let 
R
1
 be 
R
, and 
R
0
 will be
the identity relation, i.e. 
w
R
0
v
 iff 
w
=
v
.



We may now state the Scott-Lemmon result. It is that the condition on
frames which corresponds exactly to any axiom of the shape 
(
G
)
 is
the following:


w
R
h
v
&
w
R
j
u
⇒
∃
x
(
v
R
i
x
&
u
R
k
x
)
.



It is interesting to see how the familiar conditions on 
R
 result
from setting the values for 
h
, 
i
, 
j
, and 
k
 according
to the values in the corresponding axiom. For example, consider (5).
In this case 
i
=
0
, and 
h
=
j
=
k
=
1
. So the corresponding condition
is


w
R
v
&
w
R
u
⇒
∃
x
(
v
R
0
x
&
u
R
x
)
.



We have explained that 
R
0
 is the identity relation. So if 
v
R
0
x
 then 
v
=
x
. But 
∃
x
(
v
=
x
&
u
R
x
)
 is equivalent to

u
R
v
, and so the Euclidean condition is obtained:


(
w
R
v
&
w
R
u
)
⇒
u
R
v
.



In the case of axiom (4), 
h
=
0
,
i
=
1
,
j
=
2
 and 
k
=
0
. So the
corresponding condition on frames is


(
w
=
v
&
w
R
2
u
)
⇒
∃
x
(
v
R
x
&
u
=
x
)
.



Resolving the identities, this amounts to: 


v
R
2
u
⇒
v
R
u
.



By the definition of 
R
2
,
v
R
2
u
 iff 
∃
x
(
v
R
x
&
x
R
u
)
,
so this comes to:


∃
x
(
v
R
x
&
x
R
u
)
⇒
v
R
u
,



which by predicate logic, is equivalent to transitivity: 


v
R
x
&
x
R
u
⇒
v
R
u
.



The reader may find it a pleasant exercise to see how the
corresponding conditions fall out of hijk-Convergence when the values
of the parameters 
h
, 
i
, 
j
, and 
k
 are set by other
axioms.



The Scott-Lemmon results provides a quick method for establishing
results about the relationship between axioms and their corresponding
frame conditions. Since they showed the adequacy of any logic that
extends 
K
 with a selection of axioms of the form 
(
G
)
 with
respect to models that satisfy the corresponding set of frame
conditions, they provided “wholesale” adequacy proofs for
the majority of systems in the modal family. Sahlqvist (1975) has
discovered important generalizations of the Scott-Lemmon result
covering a much wider range of axiom types.


10. Two Dimensional Semantics



Two-dimensional semantics is a variant of possible world semantics
that uses two (or more) kinds of parameters in truth evaluation,
rather than possible worlds alone. For example, a logic of indexical
expressions, such as ‘I’, ‘here’,
‘now’, and the like, needs to bring in the linguistic
context (or context for short). Given a context 
c
=
⟨
s
,
p
,
t
⟩
 where 
s
 is the speaker, 
p
 the place, and 
t
 the
time of utterance, then ‘I’ refers to 
s
,
‘here’ to 
p
, and ‘now’ to 
t
. So in the
context 
c
=
⟨
Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on
4/3/
2014
⟩
 ‘I am here now’ is T iff Jim Garson is
in Houston, at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014.



In possible worlds semantics, a sentence’s truth-value depended
on the world at which it is evaluated. However, indexicals bring in a
second dimension – so we need to generalize again. Kaplan (1989)
defines the 
character
 of a sentence 
B
 to be a function
from the set of (linguistic) contexts to the content of 
B
, where
the content, in turn, is simply the intension of 
B
, that is, a
function from possible worlds to truth-values. Here, truth evaluation
is doubly dependent – on both linguistic contexts and possible
worlds.



One of Kaplan’s most interesting observations is that some
indexical sentences are contingent but at the same time analytically
true. An example is (1).




(1)
 
 I am here now.






Just from the meaning of the words, you can see that (1) must be true
in any context 
c
=
⟨
s
,
p
,
t
⟩
. After all, 
c
 counts
as a linguistic context just in case 
s
 is a speaker who is at
place 
p
 at time 
t
. Therefore (1) is true at 
c
, and that
means that the pattern of truth-values (1) has along the context
dimension must be all Ts (given the possible world is held fixed).
This suggests that the context dimension is apt for tracking analytic
knowledge obtained from the mastery of our language. On the other
hand, the possible-worlds dimension keeps track of what is necessary.
Holding the context fixed, there there are possible worlds where (1)
is false. For example, when 
c
=
⟨
Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00
P.M. CST on 4/3/
2014
⟩
, (1) fails at 
c
 in a possible
world where Jim Garson is in Boston at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. It
follows that ‘I am here now’ is a contingent analytic
truth. Therefore, two-dimensional semantics can handle situations
where necessity and analyticity come apart.



Another example where bringing in two dimension is useful is in the
logic for an open future (Thomason, 1984; Belnap, et al., 2001). Here
one employs a temporal structure where many possible future histories
extend from a given time. Consider (2).




(2)
 
 Joe will order a
sea battle tomorrow. 





If (2) is contingent, then there is a possible history where the
battle occurs the day after the time of evaluation and another one
where it does not occur then. So to evaluate (2) you need to know two
things: what is the time 
t
 of evaluation, and which of the
histories 
h
 that run through 
t
 is the one to be considered. So
a sentence in such a logic is evaluated at a pair 
⟨
t
,
h
⟩
.



Another problem resolved by two-dimensional semantics is the
interaction between ‘now’ and other temporal expressions
like the future tense ‘it will be the case that’. It is
plausible to think that ‘now’ refers to the time of
evaluation. So we would have the following truth condition:


v
(
Now
B
,
t
)
=
T
 iff 
v
(
B
,
t
)
=
T
.



However this will not work for sentences like (3).




(3)
 
 At some point in
the future, everyone now living will be unknown. 





With 
F
 as the future tense operator, (3) might be
translated:


F
∀
x
(
Now
L
x
→
U
x
)
.



(The correct translation cannot be 
∀
x
(
Now
L
x
→
F
U
x
)
, with 
F
 taking narrow scope,
because (3) says there is a future time when all things now living are
unknown together, not that each living thing will be unknown in some
future time of its own.) When the truth conditions for (3)
′
 are
calculated, using (Now) and the truth condition (
F
) for

F
, it turns out that (3)
′
 is true at time 
u
 iff
there is a time 
t
 after 
u
 such that everything that is living
at 
t
 (not 
u
!) is unknown at 
t
.


v
(
F
B
,
t
)
=
T
 iff for some time 
u
 later than 
t
,
v
(
B
,
u
)
=
T
.



To evaluate (3)
′
 correctly, so that it matches what we mean by
(3), we must make sure that ‘now’ always refers back to
the original time of utterance when ‘now’ lies in the
scope of other temporal operators such as F. Therefore we need to keep
track of which time is the time of utterance 
(
u
)
 as well as which
time is the time of evaluation 
(
t
)
. So our indices take the form
of a pair 
⟨
u
,
e
⟩
, where 
u
 is the time of
utterance, and 
e
 is the time of evaluation. Then the truth
condition (Now) is revised to (2DNow).


v
(
Now
B
,
⟨
u
,
e
⟩
)
=
T
 iff 
v
(
B
,
⟨
u
,
u
⟩
)
=
T
.



This has it that the Now
B
 is true at a time 
u
 of utterance and
time 
e
 of evaluation provided that 
B
 is true when 
u
 is
taken to be the time of evaluation. When the truth conditions for F,

∀
, and 
→
 are revised in the obvious way (just
ignore the 
u
 in the pair), (3)
′
 is true at 
⟨
u
,
e
⟩
 provided that there is a time 
e
′
 later than 
e
 such
that everything that is living at 
u
 is unknown at 
e
′
. By
carrying along a record of what 
u
 is during the truth calculation,
we can always fix the value for ‘now’ to the original time
of utterance, even when ‘now’ is deeply embedded in other
temporal operators.



A similar phenomenon arises in modal logics with an actuality operator
A (read ‘it is actually the case that’). To properly
evaluate (4) we need to keep track of which world is taken to be the
actual (or real) world as well as which one is taken to be the world
of evaluation.




(4)
 
 It is possible
that everyone actually living be unknown. 





The idea of distinguishing different possible world dimensions in
semantics has had useful applications in philosophy. For example,
Chalmers (1996) has presented arguments from the conceivability of
(say) zombies to dualist conclusions in the philosophy of mind.
Chalmers (2006) has deployed two-dimensional semantics to help
identify an a priori aspect of meaning that would support such
conclusions.



The idea has also been deployed in the philosophy of language. Kripke
(1980) famously argued that ‘Water is H2O’ is a posteriori
but nevertheless a necessary truth, for given that water just is H20,
there is no possible world where THAT stuff is (say) a basic element
as the Greeks thought. On the other hand, there is a strong intuition
that had the real world been somewhat different from what it is, the
odorless liquid that falls from the sky as rain, fills our lakes and
rivers, etc. might perfectly well have been an element. So in some
sense it is conceivable that water is not H20. Two dimensional
semantics makes room for these intuitions by providing a separate
dimension that tracks a conception of water that lays aside the
chemical nature of what water actually is. Such a ‘narrow
content’ account of the meaning of ‘water’ can
explain how one may display semantical competence in the use of that
term and still be ignorant about the chemistry of water (Chalmers,

11. Provability Logics



Modal logic has been useful in clarifying our understanding of central
results concerning provability in the foundations of mathematics
(Boolos, 1993). Provability logics are systems where the propositional
variables 
p
,
q
,
r
, etc. range over formulas of some mathematical
system, for example Peano’s system 
P
A
 for
arithmetic. (The system chosen for mathematics might vary, but assume
it is 
P
A
 for this discussion.) Gödel showed that
arithmetic has strong expressive powers. Using code numbers for
arithmetic sentences, he was able to demonstrate a correspondence
between sentences of mathematics and facts about which sentences are
and are not provable in 
P
A
. For example, he showed there
there is a sentence 
C
 that is true just in case no contradiction
is provable in 
P
A
 and there is a sentence 
G
 (the
famous Gödel sentence) that is true just in case it is not
provable in 
P
A
.



In provability logics, 
◻
p
 is interpreted as a formula (of
arithmetic) that expresses that what 
p
 denotes is provable in

P
A
. Using this notation, sentences of provability logic
express facts about provability. Suppose that 
⊥
 is a constant
of provability logic denoting a contradiction. Then 
∼
◻
⊥
 says that 
P
A
 is consistent and 
◻
A
→
A
 says that 
P
A
 is sound in the sense that when it
proves 
A
,
A
 is indeed true. Furthermore, the box may be iterated.
So, for example, 
◻
∼
◻
⊥
 makes the dubious claim that

P
A
 is able to prove its own consistency, and 
∼
◻
⊥
→
∼
◻
∼
◻
⊥
 asserts (correctly as
Gödel proved) that if 
P
A
 is consistent then

P
A
 is unable to prove its own consistency.



Although provability logics form a family of related systems, the
system 
G
L
 is by far the best known. It results from
adding the following axiom to 
K
:


◻
(
◻
A
→
A
)
→
◻
A
.



The axiom (4): 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
 is provable in

G
L
, so 
G
L
 is actually a strengthening of

K
4
. However, axioms such as 
(
M
)
:
◻
A
→
A
,
and even the weaker 
(
D
)
:
◻
A
→
◊
A
 are not
available (nor desirable) in 
G
L
. In provability logic,
provability is not to be treated as a brand of necessity. The reason
is that when 
p
 is provable in an arbitrary system 
S

for mathematics, it does not follow that 
p
 is true, since

S
 may be unsound. Furthermore, if 
p
 is provable in

S
(
◻
p
)
 it need not even follow that 
∼
p
 lacks
a proof 
(
∼
◻
∼
p
=
◊
p
)
.
S
 might be
inconsistent and so prove both 
p
 and 
∼
p
.



Axiom 
(
G
L
)
 captures the content of Loeb’s Theorem, an
important result in the foundations of arithmetic. 
◻
A
→
A
 says that 
P
A
 is sound for 
A
, i.e. that if 
A

were proven, A would be true. (Such a claim might not be secure for an
arbitrarily selected system 
S
, since 
A
 might be
provable in 
S
 and false.) 
(
G
L
)
 claims that if

P
A
 manages to prove the sentence that claims soundness
for a given sentence 
A
, then 
A
 is already provable in

P
A
. Loeb’s Theorem reports a kind of modesty on

P
A
’s part (Boolos, 1993, p. 55). 
P
A

never insists (proves) that a proof of 
A
 entails 
A
’s
truth, unless it already has a proof of 
A
 to back up that
claim.



It has been shown that 
G
L
 is adequate for provability in
the following sense. Let a sentence of 
G
L
 be 
always
provable
 exactly when the sentence of arithmetic it denotes is
provable no matter how its variables are assigned values to sentences
of 
P
A
. Then the provable sentences of 
G
L
 are
exactly the sentences that are always provable. This adequacy result
has been extremely useful, since general questions concerning
provability in 
P
A
 can be transformed into easier
questions about what can be demonstrated in 
G
L
.




G
L
 can also be outfitted with a possible world semantics
for which it is sound and complete. A corresponding condition on
frames for 
G
L
-validity is that the frame be transitive,
finite and irreflexive.

12. Advanced Modal Logic



The applications of modal logic to mathematics and computer science
have become increasingly important. Provability logic is only one
example of this trend. The term “advanced modal logic”
refers to a tradition in modal logic research that is particularly
well represented in departments of mathematics and computer science.
This tradition has been woven into the history of modal logic right
from its beginnings (Goldblatt, 2006). Research into relationships
with topology and algebras represents some of the very first technical
work on modal logic. However the term ‘advanced modal
logic’ generally refers to a second wave of work done since the
mid 1970s. Some examples of the many interesting topics dealt with
include results on decidability (whether it is possible to compute
whether a formula of a given modal logic is a theorem) and complexity
(the costs in time and memory needed to compute such facts about modal
logics). The next two sections describe examples of research in this
tradition.


13. Bisimulation



Bisimulation provides a good example of the fruitful interactions that
have been developed between modal logic and computer science. In
computer science, labeled transition systems (LTSs) are commonly used
to represent possible computation pathways during execution of a
program. LTSs are generalizations of Kripke frames, consisting of a
set 
W
 of states and a collection of 
i
-accessibility relations

R
i
, one for each computer process 
i
. Intuitively, 
w
R
i
w
′

holds exactly when 
w
′
 is a state that results from applying the
process 
i
 to state 
w
.



The language of poly-modal or dynamic logic introduces a collection of
modal operators 
◻
i
, one for each program 
i
 (Harel, 1984).
Then 
◻
i
A
 states that sentence 
A
 holds in every result of
applying 
i
. So ideas like the correctness and successful
termination of programs can be expressed in this language. Models for
such a language are like Kripke models save that LTSs are used in
place of frames. A 
bisimulation
 is a counterpart relation
between states of two such models such that exactly the same
propositional variables are true in counterpart states, and whenever
world 
v
 is 
i
-accessible from one of two counterpart states,
then the other counterpart bears the 
i
-accessibility relation to
some counterpart of 
v
. In short, the 
i
-accessibility structure
one can “see” from a given state mimics what one sees from
a counterpart. Bisimulation is a weaker notion than isomorphism (a
bisimulation relation need not be 1-1), but it is sufficient to
guarantee equivalence in processing.



In the 70s, bisimulation had already been developed by modal logicians
to help better understand the relationship between modal logic axioms
and their corresponding conditions on Kripke frames. Kripke’s
semantics provides a basis for translating modal formulas into
sentences of first-order logic with quantification over possible
worlds. Replace metavariables 
A
 in an axiom with open sentences

A
x
, and translate 
◻
A
x
 to 
∀
y
(
R
x
y
→
A
y
)
, in the result. (The translation for 
◊
A
x
 is given by

∃
y
(
R
x
y
&
A
y
)
.) For example, the translation of the
axiom schema 
◊
◻
A
→
A
 comes to 
∃
y
(
R
x
y
&
∀
z
(
R
y
z
→
A
z
)
)
→
A
x
. This open
formula with a free variable ‘
x
’ reflects what

◊
◻
A
→
A
 “says” in the language of
first-order logic. Obviously the translations of modal formulas are
special; most first-order formulas are not equivalent to the result of
translating modal formulas in this way. The modal translations form a
special subset of the predicate logic language, which delimits what
modal logic formulas can express. 



Is there any interesting way to characterize the expressive power of
the modal translations? The answer is that bisimulation serves exactly
that purpose. Van Benthem showed (Blackburn et al., 2001, p. 103) that
a first-order formula is equivalent to a modal translation exactly
when its holding in a model entails that it holds in any bisimular
model, and the idea easily generalizes to the poly-modal case. This
suggests that poly-modal logic lies at exactly the right level of
abstraction to describe, and reason about, computation and other
processes. (After all, what really matters there is the preservation
of truth values of formulas in models, rather than the finer details
of the frame structures.) Furthermore, the implicit translation of
modal logics into well-understood fragments of predicate logic
provides a wealth of information of interest to computer scientists.
As a result, a fruitful area of research in computer science has
developed with bisimulation as its core idea (Ponse 
et al.

1995).


14. Frame Validity and Incompleteness



Work on modal logic in the 60s was primarily concerned with obtaining
completeness results with respect to various conditions on the
accessibility relation. However as research progressed into the 70s,
deeper connections were discovered concerning what modal axioms
express about frames. A central idea in this work is the notion of
frame validity, which differs from the kind of validity which was laid
out in Section 6 above. There an argument was considered valid for a
set of conditions 
C
 on frames exactly when for every model

⟨
W
,
R
,
v
⟩
 whose frame obeys 
C
, and every world

w
 in 
W
, the truth of the premises at 
w
 entails the truth
of the conclusion at 
w
. In short, model validity amounts to
preservation of truth on every model. Frame validity, on the other
hand, focuses more clearly on the frames of the model. A sentence is
said to be 
valid on a frame
 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 iff it is
true in every world in any model with frame 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
.
Then an argument is ruled 
frame valid
 for a set of conditions

C
 on frames iff it preserves frame validity, that is, for every
frame that obeys 
C
, if the premises are valid on that frame, then
so is the conclusion.



Frame validity appears a better way to understand what a modal axiom
expresses about frames. There are models that assign the axiom (M):

◻
A
→
A
 true, even though its frame does not satisfy
reflexivity - the corresponding frame condition for (M). That is
because the valuation function for a model can be specially crafted so
that it does the work of ensuring that 
◻
A
→
A
 is
true. However, as we will soon see, if 
◻
A
→
A
 is
valid for frame 
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
, then it follows that

⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is reflexive. By abstracting away from details
about the valuation function, one obtains better insight into the
relationship between axioms and frame conditions.



The concept of frame validity provides a basis for translating what
modal axioms express into sentences of a second-order language where
quantification is allowed over one-place predicate letters 
P
.
Replace metavariables 
A
 with open sentences 
P
x
, translate

◻
P
x
 to 
∀
y
(
R
x
y
→
P
y
)
, and close free
variables 
x
 and predicate letters 
P
 with universal
quantifiers. For example, the predicate logic translation of the axiom
schema 
◻
A
→
A
 comes to 
∀
P
∀
x
[
∀
y
(
R
x
y
→
P
y
)
→
P
x
]. (The basis for the
quantification over the predicate letters P is that frame validity
quantifies over all valuations of the propositional variables p, but
valuations over p are functions from the set of possible worlds to
truth values, and these can be likened to properties of worlds
expressed by p, namely the property that world w has when p is true
there.) 



Given this translation for 
◻
A
→
A
, one may
instantiate the variable 
P
 to an arbitrary one-place predicate,
for example to the predicate 
R
x
 whose extension is the set of all
worlds w such that 
R
x
w
 for a given value of 
x
. Then one
obtains 
∀
x
[
∀
y
(
R
x
y
→
R
x
y
)
→
R
x
x
],
which reduces to 
∀
x
R
x
x
, since 
∀
y
(
R
x
y
→
R
x
y
)
 is a tautology. This illuminates the correspondence between

◻
A
→
A
 and reflexivity of frames 
(
∀
x
R
x
x
)
.
Similar results hold for many other axioms and frame conditions. The
“collapse” of second-order axiom conditions to first-order
frame conditions is very helpful in locating how axioms correspond to
frame conditions, and in obtaining completeness results for various
modal logics. For example, this is the core idea behind the elegant
results of Sahlqvist (1975), which are described in (Blackburn et al.,
2001, Ch. 3, especially section 3.6).



The striking successes along these lines suggests that every modal
logic can be shown to be sound and complete with respect to the frame
conditions that its axioms express. Unfortunately, this is not the
case. Some logics are incomplete for their frame conditions as is
illustrated by the following example (Boolos, 1993 pp. 148ff). The
provability logic GL results from adding the axiom 
◻
(
◻
A
→
A
)
→
◻
A
 to the basic modal logic K.
System H results from adding the weaker axiom: 
◻
(
◻
A
↔
A
)
→
◻
A
 to K. GL is stronger than H as
it is able to prove the standard axiom for S4: 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
, but H is not. The problem is that GL and H express
equivalent second-order conditions. That means in turn that H is
incomplete, for it cannot prove a formula 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
 which is in fact valid for the frames it expresses.



So from the frame validity perspective, there is no way to always
convert the second-order translation of an axiom into a first-order
frame condition for which a given system is both sound and complete.
The reason is that if there were, both GL and H would have to be sound
and complete with respect to the same first order condition C. But
that means (by soundness of GL) that 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A

would be frame valid for C, but not provable in H. The upshot is that
in general, what modal logics express in the frame-validity paradigm
may be more powerful than what can be said in a first-order
language.


15. Modal Logic and Games



The interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a
flourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van
Benthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting
applications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents
as information available to them evolves. 



The Prisoner’s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game
theory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players
that choose to either cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, they
both achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both defect, they both get
1 point, and if one cooperates and the other defects, the defector
makes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both
players are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their
rewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do
together. However, they are both tempted to defect to increase their
own reward from 3 to 5, leaving their opponent with nothing. On the
other hand, if they are both rational, they may recognize that if
defection is the best strategy, their opponent will choose this as
well, leaving them with only 1 point. So unless there is enough trust
between the players to motivate cooperation, they will be doomed to
receiving 1 point apiece. However, if each thinks the other realizes
this, they may be willing to risk cooperating anyway.



An extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players
multiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect
rewards. If players have information about the history of the moves
and their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the
game depends on knowing their opponent’s strategy and
determining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to defect. In
multi-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs
from a larger pool at each move, one’s own best strategy may
well depend on whether one can recognize one’s opponents and the
strategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating
research on Interated Prisoner’s Dilemmas.) 



In games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their
opponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the
players in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated
Prisoner’s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the
state of play – the player with the second turn lacks
information about what the other player’s last move was. This
illustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. 



The application of games to logic has a long history. One influential
application with important implications for linguistics is Game
Theoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is
defined by the outcome of a game between two players, one trying to
verify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has
significantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics,
as it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a
discourse (a sequence of sentences).



However, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is
somewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of
a logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The
structure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the
nature of the game itself (the allowed moves and the rewards for the
outcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time),
and the flow of information available to the players as the game
progresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws
on features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency,
preference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. 



To provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of
some of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and
some of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in
the semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3,
…, and a set of W of game states. For each player 
i
, there
is an accessibility relation 
R
i
 understood so that 
s
R
i
t

holds for states 
s
 and 
t
 iff when the game has come to state

s
 player 
i
 has the option of making a move that results in

t
. This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches
define every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics
also assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,
for example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom 
win
i

such that 
v
(
win
i
,
s
)
=
T
 iff state 
s
 is a win for player

i
. Model operators 
◻
i
 and 
◊
i
 for each player

i
 may then be given truth conditions as follows.


v
(
◻
i
A
,
s
)
=
T
 iff for all 
t
 in 
W
,
 if 
s
R
i
t
,
 then 
v
(
A
,
t
)
=
T
.
v
(
◊
i
A
,
s
)
=
T
 iff for some 
t
 in 
W
,
s
R
i
t
 and 
v
(
A
,
t
)
=
T
.



So 
◻
i
A
 
(
◊
i
A
)
 is true in s provided that sentence

A
 holds true in every (some) state that 
i
 can chose from state

s
. Given that 
⊥
 is a contradiction (so 
∼
⊥
 is a
tautology), 
◊
i
∼
⊥
 is true at a state when it is

i
’s turn to move. For a two-player game 
◻
1
⊥
 &

◻
2
⊥
 is true of a state that ends the game, because neither
1 nor 2 can move. 
◻
1
◊
2
win
2
 asserts that player 1
has a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win
in the following move. 



For a more general account of the player’s payoffs, ordering
relations 
≤
i
 can be defined over the states so that 
s
≤
i
t
 means that 
i
’s payoff for 
t
 is at least as good as
that for 
s
. Another generalization is to express facts about
sequences 
q
 of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by
relations 
s
R
q
t
 indicating that the sequence 
q
 starting from
s eventually arrives at 
t
. With these and related resources, it is
possible to express (for example) that 
q
 is 
i
’s best
strategy given the present state.



It is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the
information available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to
borrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an
accessibility relation 
∼
i
 for each player such that

s
∼
i
t
 holds iff 
i
 cannot distinguish between states

s
 and 
t
. Then knowledge operators 
K
i
 for the players
can be defined so that 
K
i
A
 says at 
s
 that 
A
 holds in
all worlds that 
i
 cannot distinguish from 
s
; that is, despite

i
’s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be
confident that 
A
. 
K
 operators may be used to say that player
1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win:

K
1
K
2
◻
1
◊
2
win
2
.



Since player’s information varies as the game progresses, it is
useful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to
introduce operators 
O
 and 
U
 from tense logic for
‘next’ and ‘until’. Then 
K
i
O
A
→
O
K
i
A
 expresses that player 
i
 has “perfect recall”,
that is, that when 
i
 knows that 
A
 happens next, then at the
next moment 
i
 has not forgotten that 
A
 has happened. This
illustrates how modal logics for games can reflect cognitive
idealizations and a player’s success (or failure) at living up
to them.



The technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The
project of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete
for a language containing a large collection of operators may be
guided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of
accessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the
computational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a
large landscape largely unexplored.



Game theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways
– from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the
political arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating
logics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is
the power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency,
knowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons
learned from that integration have value well beyond what they
contribute to understanding games.


16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic



It would seem to be a simple matter to outfit a modal logic with the
quantifiers 
∀
 (all) and 
∃
 (some). One would simply
add the standard (or classical) rules for quantifiers to the
principles of whichever propositional modal logic one chooses.
However, adding quantifiers to modal logic involves a number of
difficulties. Some of these are philosophical. For example, Quine
(1953) has famously argued that quantifying into modal contexts is
simply incoherent, a view that has spawned a gigantic literature.
Quine’s complaints do not carry the weight they once did. See
Barcan (1990) for a good summary, and note Kripke’s (2017)
(written in the 60’s for a class with Quine) which provides a
strong formal argument that there can be nothing wrong with
“quantifying in”.



A second kind of complication is technical. There is a wide variety in
the choices one can make in the semantics for quantified modal logic,
and the proof that a system of rules is correct for a given choice can
be difficult. The work of Corsi (2002) and Garson (2005) goes some way
towards bringing unity to this terrain, and Johannesson (2018)
introduces constraints that help reduce the number of options;
nevertheless the situation still remains challenging.



Another complication is that some logicians believe that modality
requires abandoning classical quantifier rules in favor of the weaker
rules of free logic (Garson 2001). The main points of disagreement
concerning the quantifier rules can be traced back to decisions about
how to handle the domain of quantification. The simplest alternative,
the fixed-domain (sometimes called the possibilist) approach, assumes
a single domain of quantification that contains all the possible
objects. On the other hand, the world-relative (or actualist)
interpretation, assumes that the domain of quantification changes from
world to world, and contains only the objects that actually exist in a
given world.



The fixed-domain approach requires no major adjustments to the
classical machinery for the quantifiers. Modal logics that are
adequate for fixed domain semantics can usually be axiomatized by
adding principles of a propositional modal logic to classical
quantifier rules together with the Barcan Formula 
(
B
F
)
 (Barcan
1946). (For an account of some interesting exceptions see Cresswell
(1995).)


∀
x
◻
A
→
◻
∀
x
A
.



The fixed-domain interpretation has advantages of simplicity and
familiarity, but it does not provide a direct account of the semantics
of certain quantifier expressions of natural language. We do not think
that ‘Some man exists who signed the Declaration of
Independence’ is true, at least not if we read
‘exists’ in the present tense. Nevertheless, this sentence
was true in 1777, which shows that the domain for the natural language
expression ‘some man exists who’ changes to reflect which
men exist at different times. A related problem is that on the
fixed-domain interpretation, the sentence 
∀
y
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
y
)
 is valid. Assuming that 
∃
x
(
x
=
y
)
 is read: 
y

exists, 
∀
y
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
y
)
 says that everything exists
necessarily. However, it seems a fundamental feature of common ideas
about modality that the existence of many things is contingent and
that different objects exist in different possible worlds. 



The defender of the fixed-domain interpretation may respond to these
objections by insisting that on his (her) reading of the quantifiers,
the domain of quantification contains 
all
 possible objects,
not just the objects that happen to exist at a given world. So the
theorem 
∀
y
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
y
)
 makes the innocuous claim
that every 
possible
 object is necessarily found in the domain
of all possible objects. Furthermore, those quantifier expressions of
natural language whose domain is world (or time) dependent can be
expressed using the fixed-domain quantifier 
∃
x
 and a
predicate letter 
E
 with the reading ‘actually exists’.
For example, instead of translating ‘Some 
M
an exists who

S
igned the Declaration of Independence’ by


∃
x
(
M
x
&
S
x
)
,



the defender of fixed domains may write: 


∃
x
(
E
x
&
M
x
&
S
x
)
,



thus ensuring the translation is counted false at the present time.
Cresswell (1991) makes the interesting observation that world-relative
quantification has limited expressive power relative to fixed-domain
quantification. World-relative quantification can be defined with
fixed-domain quantifiers and 
E
, but there is no way to fully
express fixed-domain quantifiers with world-relative ones. Although
this argues in favor of the classical approach to quantified modal
logic, the translation tactic also amounts to something of a
concession in favor of free logic, for the world-relative quantifiers
so defined obey exactly the free logic rules. 



A problem with the translation strategy used by defenders of
fixed-domain quantification is that rendering the English into logic
is less direct, since 
E
 must be added to all translations of all
sentences whose quantifier expressions have domains that are context
dependent. A more serious objection to fixed-domain quantification is
that it strips the quantifier of a role which Quine recommended for
it, namely to record robust ontological commitment. On this view, the
domain of 
∃
x
 must contain only entities that are
ontologically respectable, and possible objects are too abstract to
qualify. Actualists of this stripe will want to develop the logic of a
quantifier 
∃
x
 which reflects commitment to what is actual
in a given world rather than to what is merely possible.



However, some work on actualism tends to undermine this objection. For
example, Linsky and Zalta (1994) and Williamson (2013) argue that the
fixed-domain quantifier can be given an interpretation that is
perfectly acceptable to actualists. Pavone (2018) even contends that
on the haecceitist interpretation, which quantifies over individual
essences, fixed domains are required. Actualists who employ possible
worlds semantics routinely quantify over possible worlds in their
semantical theory of language. So it would seem that possible worlds
are actual by these actualist’s lights. By populating the domain
with abstract entities no more objectionable than possible worlds,
actualists may vindicate the Barcan Formula and classical
principles. 



However, recent work suggests that the fixed domain option may not be
as actualist as originally thought; see Menzel 2020 and the entry on

the possibilism-actualism
debate
. And some actualists might respond that they need not be
committed to the actuality of possible worlds so long as it is
understood that quantifiers used in their theory of language lack
strong ontological import. Furthermore, Hayaki (2006) argues that
quantifying over abstract entities is actually incompatible with any
serious form of actualism. In any case, it is open to actualists (and
non-actualists as well) to investigate the logic of quantifiers with
more robust domains, for example domains excluding possible worlds and
other such abstract entities, and containing only the spatio-temporal
particulars found in a given world. For quantifiers of this kind,
world-relative domains are appropriate.



Such considerations motivate interest in systems that acknowledge the
context dependence of quantification by introducing world-relative
domains. Here each possible world has its own domain of quantification
(the set of objects that actually exist in that world), and the
domains vary from one world to the next. When this decision is made, a
difficulty arises for classical quantification theory. Notice that the
sentence 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is a theorem of classical logic, and so

◻
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is a theorem of 
K
 by the Necessitation
Rule. Let the term 
t
 stand for Saul Kripke. Then this theorem says
that it is necessary that Saul Kripke exists, so that he is in the
domain of every possible world. The whole motivation for the
world-relative approach was to reflect the idea that objects in one
world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rulers are
used, however, every term 
t
 must refer to something that exists in
all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary
practice of using terms to refer to things that only exist
contingently.



One response to this difficulty is simply to eliminate terms. Kripke
(1963) gives an example of a system that uses the world-relative
interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs
are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and
second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be
weakened.



Presuming that we would like a language that includes terms, and that
classical rules are to be added to standard systems of propositional
modal logic, a new problem arises. In such a system, it is possible to
prove 
(
C
B
F
)
, the converse of the Barcan Formula.


◻
∀
x
A
→
∀
x
◻
A
.



This fact has serious consequences for the system’s semantics.
It is not difficult to show that every world-relative model of

(
C
B
F
)
 must meet condition 
(
N
D
)
 (for ‘nested
domains’). 




(
N
D
)
 
 
 If 
w
R
v

then the domain of 
w
 is a subset of the domain of 
v
.






However 
(
N
D
)
 conflicts with the point of introducing
world-relative domains. The whole idea was that existence of objects
is contingent so that there are accessible possible worlds where one
of the things in our world fails to exist. 



A straightforward solution to these problems is to abandon classical
rules for the quantifiers and to adopt rules for free logic

(
F
L
)
 instead. The rules of 
F
L
 are the same
as the classical rules, except that inferences from 
∀
x
R
x

(everything is real) to 
R
p
 (Pegasus is real) are blocked. This is
done by introducing a predicate ‘
E
’ (for
‘actually exists’) and modifying the rule of universal
instantiation. From 
∀
x
R
x
 one is allowed to obtain 
R
p

only if one also has obtained 
E
p
. Assuming that the universal
quantifier 
∀
x
 is primitive, and the existential quantifier

∃
x
 is defined by 
∃
x
A
=
d
f
∼
∀
x
∼
A
, then 
F
L
 may be constructed by adding the
following two principles to the rules of propositional logic.



Free Universal Generalization.


If 
B
→
(
E
y
→
A
(
y
)
)
 is a theorem, so is

B
→
∀
x
A
(
x
)
.



Free Universal Instantiation.



∀
x
A
(
x
)
→
(
E
t
→
A
(
t
)
)
 



(Here it is assumed that 
A
(
x
)
 is any well-formed formula of
predicate logic and that 
A
(
y
)
 and 
A
(
t
)
 result from replacing

y
 and 
t
 properly for each occurrence of 
x
 in 
A
(
x
)
.)
Note that the instantiation axiom is restricted by mention of 
E
t

in the antecedent. The rule of Free Universial Generalization is
modified in the same way. In 
F
L
, proofs of formulas like

∃
x
◻
(
x
=
t
)
, 
∀
y
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
y
)
, 
(
C
B
F
)
,
and 
(
B
F
)
, which seem incompatible with the world-relative
interpretation, are blocked. 



One philosophical objection to 
F
L
 is that 
E
 appears
to be an existence predicate, and many would argue that existence is
not a legitimate property like being green or weighing more than four
pounds. So philosophers who reject the idea that existence is a
predicate may object to 
F
L
. However in most (but not all)
quantified modal logics that include identity 
(
=
)
 these worries
may be skirted by defining 
E
 as follows.


E
t
=
d
f
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
.



The most general way to formulate quantified modal logic is to create

F
S
 by adding the rules of 
F
L
 to a given
propositional modal logic 
S
. In situations where
classical quantification is desired, one may simply add 
E
t
 as an
axiom to 
F
S
, so that the classical principles become
derivable rules. Adequacy results for such systems can be obtained for
most choices of the modal logic 
S
, but there are
exceptions (Cresswell (1995). 



There is another way to formulate quantified modal logics for
world-relative domains that avoids the non-standard quantifier rules
of free logic and allows term constants in the language. Deutsch
(1990) shows how to define such a semantics, where the classical
principle 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 comes out valid. His strategy is inspired
by Kaplan’s (1989) idea that validity and necessity may part
company. (See the discussion of two-dimensional semantics in
 
Section 10

 above.) Kaplan showed that there are sentences such as ‘I am
here now’ that qualify as logically valid, because they are true
in any context of their assertion, but which are not necessary. That
suggests a reply to anyone who objects to the classical theorem

∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 on the grounds that ‘
t
 exists’ is
not necessary. One need only point out that the validity of 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is in fact compatible with its contingency.



Special adjustments to the formal semantics are needed to flesh out
this idea. Deutsch introduces what he calls ‘contexts of
origin’ as sequences of possible worlds. (These are not to be
confused with Kaplan’s linguistic contexts.) However, Stephanou
(2002) shows how to streamline the definition of a model so that this
extra machinery is avoided. Deutsch’s main idea is that a model
distinguishes one of the possible worlds 
w
∗
 as actual, and the
term constants are directly assigned referents in the domain for

w
∗
. That ensures that 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is true in 
w
∗
.
Although 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is false in other worlds where the
referent of 
t
 does not exist, the definition of validity for this
semantics rates a sentence true provided it is true at the actual
world 
w
∗
 for each model. The result is that 
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)

and all classical quantifier principles are rated valid, even though

◻
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is not.



Stephanou (2002) provides a set of axioms and rules that exactly
capture this notion of validity. Classical laws of quantification are
preserved in the sense that the provable formulas lacking any modal
operator are the classical ones. However, restrictions must be placed
on the rules of propositional modal logic. The Necessitation Rule (If

A
 is a theorem, then so is 
◻
A
) cannot be accepted because

∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is valid, while 
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 is not.
Furthermore, the rules for quantification are more complex. Two axioms
of Universal Instantiation are needed. One is restricted: 
∀
x
A
(
x
)
→
(
F
t
→
A
(
t
)
)
, where 
F
t
 is any atomic
sentence containing term 
t
. Since the semantics requires all
predicate letters to have extensions for a world in the domain of that
world, 
F
t
 ensures that 
t
 refers to something that exists. So
this restricted axiom reminds one of Free Universal Instantiation. The
second axiom is an unrestricted form of Instantiation: 
∀
x
A
(
x
)
→
A
(
t
)
. However, this principle comes with the
proviso that once it is used in a proof, no axioms or rules may be
used other than it and Modus Ponens. This has the effect of blocking
the use of Necessitation to obtain 
◻
∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
 from

∃
x
(
x
=
t
)
.



Note that this strategy cannot treat all proper names in English as
terms of the formal language, since those terms refer to what exists
in the actual world. Therefore names for fictional entities
(‘Pegasus’) must be dealt with in another way, perhaps
with Russell’s theory of descriptions. An alternative treatment
would also be need in a temporal logic for names of those who are
deceased (‘Benjamin Franklin’).



A final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is
worth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as
‘the inventor of bifocals’ are introduced to the language.
A term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different
possible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by
what Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks
out the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach
to dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell’s theory of
descriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions
as genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free
logic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem cannot be
resolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A
solution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the
quantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual
concepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation
provides a better match between the treatment of terms and the
treatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for
classical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains
or world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language
with strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap
and Müller, 2013a, 2013b). (See also Aloni (2005) who explores
the pros and cons of quantifying over individual concepts in
epistemic logic.)
