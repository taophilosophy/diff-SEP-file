Provability Logic
First published Wed Apr 2, 2003; substantive revision Mon Mar 4, 2024





Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what
arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their
provability predicates. The logic has been inspired by developments in
meta-mathematics such as Gödel’s incompleteness theorems of
1931 and Löb’s theorem of 1953. As a modal logic,
provability logic has been studied since the early seventies, and has
had important applications in the foundations of mathematics.



From a philosophical point of view, provability logic is interesting
because the concept of provability in a fixed theory of arithmetic has
a unique and non-problematic meaning, other than concepts like
necessity and knowledge studied in modal and epistemic logic.
Furthermore, provability logic provides tools to study the notion of
self-reference.

1. The history of provability logic



Two strands of research have led to the birth of provability logic.
The first one stems from a paper by
 
K. Gödel

 (1933), where he introduces translations from intuitionistic
propositional logic into modal logic (more precisely, into the system
nowadays called S4), and briefly mentions that provability can be
viewed as a modal operator. Even earlier, C.I. Lewis started the
modern study of modal logic by introducing strict implication as a
kind of deducibility, where he may have meant deducibility in a formal
system like
 
Principia Mathematica
,
 but this is not clear from his writings.



The other strand starts from research in meta-mathematics: what can
mathematical theories say about themselves by encoding interesting
properties? In 1952, L. Henkin posed a deceptively simple question
inspired by
 
Gödel’s incompleteness theorems
.
 In order to formulate Henkin’s question, some more background
is needed. As a reminder, Gödel’s first incompleteness
theorem states that, for a sufficiently strong formal theory like
Peano Arithmetic, any sentence asserting its own unprovability is in
fact unprovable. On the other hand, from “outside” the
formal theory, one can see that such a sentence is true in the
standard model, pointing to an important distinction between truth and
provability.



More formally, let 
⌜
A
⌝
 denote the Gödel
number of arithmetical formula 
A
, which is the result of assigning
a numerical code to 
A
. Let 
Prov
 be the formalized provability
predicate for Peano Arithmetic, which is of the form 
∃
p
Proof
(
p
,
x
)
. Here, 
Proof
 is the formalized proof predicate of
Peano Arithmetic, and 
Proof
(
p
,
x
)
 stands for “Gödel
number 
p
 codes a correct proof from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic
of the formula with Gödel number 
x
”. (For a more
precise formulation, see Smoryński (1985), Davis (1958).) Now,
suppose that Peano Arithmetic proves 
A
↔
¬


Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
, then by Gödel’s result,

A
 is not provable in Peano Arithmetic, and thus it is true, for in
fact the self-referential sentence 
A
 states “I am not
provable”.



Henkin on the other hand wanted to know whether anything could be said
about sentences asserting their own provability: supposing that Peano
Arithmetic proves 
B
↔
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
,
what does this imply about 
B
? Three years later, M. Löb took
up the challenge and answered Henkin’s question in a surprising
way. Even though all sentences provable in Peano Arithmetic are indeed
true about the natural numbers, Löb showed that the formalized
version of this fact, 
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
B
,
can be proved in Peano Arithmetic only in the trivial case that Peano
Arithmetic already proves 
B
 itself. This result, now called
Löb’s theorem, immediately answers Henkin’s question.
(For a proof of Löb’s theorem, see
 
Section 4
.)
 Löb also showed a formalized version of his theorem, namely that
Peano Arithmetic proves


Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
B
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
.



In the same paper, Löb formulated three conditions on the
provability predicate of Peano Arithmetic, that form a useful
modification of the complicated conditions that Hilbert and Bernays
introduced in 1939 for their proof of Gödel’s second
incompleteness theorem. In the following, derivability of 
A
 from
Peano Arithmetic is denoted by 
PA
⊢
A
:




If 
PA
⊢
A
, then 
PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
;


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
→
B
⌝
)
→
(
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
)
;
 


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
⌝
)
.
 





These Löb conditions, as they are called nowadays, seem to cry
out for a modal logical investigation, where the modality 
◻

stands for provability in PA. Ironically, the first time that the
formalized version of Löb’s theorem was stated as the modal
principle


◻
(
◻
A
→
A
)
→
◻
A



was in a paper by Smiley in 1963 about the logical basis of ethics,
which did not consider arithmetic at all. More relevant
investigations, however, seriously started only almost twenty years
after publication of Löb’s paper. The early 1970s saw the
rapid development of propositional provability logic, where several
researchers in different countries independently proved the most
important results, discussed in Sections
 
2
,
 
3
, and
 
4
.
 Propositional provability logic turned out to capture exactly what
many formal theories of arithmetic can say by propositional means
about their own provability predicate. More recently, researchers have
investigated the boundaries of this approach and have proposed several
interesting more expressive extensions of provability logic (see
 
Section 5
).


2. The axiom system of propositional provability logic



The logical language of propositional provability logic contains, in
addition to propositional atoms and the usual truth-functional
operators as well as the contradiction symbol 
⊥
, a modal
operator 
◻
 with intended meaning “is provable in

T
,” where 
T
 is a sufficiently strong formal theory, let
us say Peano Arithmetic (see
 
Section 4
).
 
⬦
A
 is an abbreviation for 
¬
◻
¬
A
. Thus,
the language is the same as that of modal systems such as K and S4
presented in the entry
 
modal logic
.


2.1 Axioms and rules



Propositional provability logic is often called GL, after Gödel
and Löb. (Alternative names found in the literature for
equivalent systems are L, G, KW, K4W, and PrL). The logic GL results
from adding the following axiom to the basic modal logic K:


◻
(
◻
A
→
A
)
→
◻
A
.



As a reminder, because GL extends K, it contains all formulas having
the form of a propositional tautology. For the same reason, GL
contains the


◻
(
A
→
B
)
→
(
◻
A
→
◻
B
)
.



Furthermore, it is closed under the Modus Ponens Rule, which allows to
derive 
B
 from 
A
→
B
 and 
A
, and the
Generalization Rule, which says that if 
A
 is a theorem of GL, then
so is 
◻
A
.



The notion 
GL
⊢
A
 denotes provability of a modal formula

A
 in propositional provability logic. It is not difficult to see
that the modal axiom 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
 (known as Axiom
4 of modal logic) is indeed provable in GL. To prove this, one uses
the substitution 
A
∧
◻
A
 for 
A
 in the axiom (GL).
Then, seeing that the antecedent of the resulting implication follows
from 
◻
A
, one applies the Distribution Axiom and the
Generalization Rule as well as some propositional logic. 



Note that GL proves many unexpected theorems that are not shared with
other well-known modal logics such as K and S4. For example, one
instantiation of the axiom GL is 
◻
(
◻
⊥
→
⊥
)
→
◻
⊥
, from which it follows by the other axioms and
rules that 
◻
⬦
A
→
◻
B
 for any formulas

A
 and
 
B
.
[

]

 Unless explicitly stated otherwise, in the sequel “provability
logic” stands for the system GL of propositional provability
logic.



As to the 
proof theory
 of provability logic, Valentini (1983)
proved that a standard sequent calculus formulation of GL obeys

cut elimination
, which means, roughly formulated, that each
formula provable from GL in the sequent calculus also has a GL sequent
proof “without detours” (see the entry
 
the development of proof theory

 for a precise explanation of cut elimination). In recent years, there
has been renewed interest in the proof theory of GL, see for example
Goré and Ramanayake (2008, 2012) and Goré, Ramanayake
and Shillito (2021). Cut-elimination leads to the desirable

subformula property
 for GL, because all formulas that appear
in a cut-free proof are subformulas of the endsequent formulas. 



For recent proof-theoretic investigations of provability logic based
on different cut-free sequent calculi see (Negri 2005, 2014;
Poggiolesi 2009). Negri presents two equivalent labelled sequent
calculi for GL and a syntactic proof of cut elimination. Even if a
full subformula property does not hold for these calculi because of
the labelling, the usual consequences of the subformula property can
be established: The labelled formalism allows a direct completeness
proof, which can be used to establish decidability as well as the
finite model property, which means that any formula that is not
provable has a 
finite
 counter-model. 



An intriguing new proof-theoretical development is Shamkanov’s
expansion of sequent-style proof systems by allowing 
circular
proofs
 (Shamkanov 2014). Consider a sequent system for K4, the
modal system resulting from GL by replacing the axiom GL by the weaker
axiom 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
 (axiom 4). However, suppose
that open hypotheses are allowed, provided that the same sequent
occurs strictly below that hypothesis in the proof tree. Formulated
more technically, one can find a circular derivation from an ordinary
derivation tree by linking each of its non-axiomatic leaves with an
identical interior node. Shamkanov (2014) proved that the resulting
system is consistent and that moreover, in general, each sequent has a
GL-derivation if and only if it has a circular K4-derivation. Circular
proofs also provide a method to show proof-theoretically that
Lyndon’s interpolation theorem holds for GL (Shamkanov 2011).
Standard interpolation for GL had already been proved before by
different methods (Boolos 1979; Smoryński 1978; Rautenberg 1983)
and so had uniform interpolation (Shavrukov 1993b,
Bílková 2016). (For more information about
Lyndon’s interpolation theorem for first-order logic, see also
the entry
 
first-order model theory 
).


2.2 The fixed point theorem



The main “modal” result about provability logic is the
fixed point theorem, which D. de Jongh and G. Sambin independently
proved in 1975 (Sambin 1976, Smoryński 1985, de Jongh
forthcoming). Even though it is formulated and proved by strictly
modal methods, the fixed point theorem still has great arithmetical
significance. It says essentially that self-reference is not really
necessary, in the following sense. Suppose that all occurrences of the
propositional variable 
p
 in a given formula 
A
(
p
)
 are under the
scope of the provability operator, for example 
A
(
p
)
=
¬
◻
p
,
or 
A
(
p
)
=
◻
(
p
→
q
)
. Then there is a formula 
B
 in
which 
p
 does not appear, such that all propositional variables
that occur in 
B
 already appear in 
A
(
p
)
,
 and such that


GL
⊢
B
↔
A
(
B
)
.



This formula 
B
 is called a 
fixed point
 of 
A
(
p
)
.
Moreover, the fixed point is unique, or more accurately, if there is
another formula 
C
 such that 
GL
⊢
C
↔
A
(
C
)
, then we must have 
GL
⊢
B
↔
C
. Most
proofs in the literature give an algorithm by which one can compute
the fixed point (see Smoryński 1985, Boolos 1993, Sambin and
Valentini 1982, Lindström 2006). A particularly short and clear
proof, as well as a very efficient algorithm to compute fixed points,
can be found in Reidhaar-Olson (1990). 



For example, suppose that 
A
(
p
)
=
¬
◻
p
. Then the fixed
point produced by such an algorithm is 
¬
◻
⊥
, and
indeed one can prove that


GL
⊢
¬
◻
⊥
↔
¬
◻
(
¬
◻
⊥
)
.



If this is read arithmetically, the direction from left to right is
just the formalized version of Gödel’s second
incompleteness theorem: if a sufficiently strong formal theory 
T

like Peano Arithmetic does not prove a contradiction, then it is not
provable in 
T
 that 
T
 does not prove a contradiction. Thus,
sufficiently strong consistent arithmetical theories cannot prove
their own consistency. We will turn to study the relation between
provability logic and arithmetic more precisely in
 
Section 4
,
 but to that end another “modal” aspect of GL needs to be
provided first: semantics.


3. Possible worlds semantics and topological semantics



Provability logic has suitable possible worlds semantics, just like
many other modal logics. As a reminder, a possible worlds model (or
Kripke model) is a triple 
M
=
⟨
W
,
R
,
V
⟩
, where 
W

is a non-empty set of possible worlds, 
R
 is a binary accessibility
relation on 
W
, and 
V
 is a valuation that assigns a truth value
to each propositional variable for each world in 
W
. The pair 
F
=
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
 is called the frame of this model. The notion of
truth of a formula 
A
 in a model 
M
 at a world 
W
, notation

M
,
w
⊨
A
, is defined inductively. Let us repeat only the most
interesting clause, the one for the provability operator 
◻
:


M
,
w
⊨
◻
A
 iff for every 
w
′
,
 if 
w
R
w
′
,
 then 
M
,
w
′
⊨
A
.



See the entry
 
modal logic

 for more information about possible worlds semantics in general.


3.1 Characterization and modal soundness



The modal logic K is valid in all Kripke models. Its extension GL
however, is not: we need to restrict the class of possible worlds
models to a more suitable one. Let us say that a formula 
A
 is
valid in frame 
F
, notation 
F
⊨
A
, iff 
A
 is true in
all worlds in Kripke models 
M
 based on 
F
. It turns out that
the new axiom (GL) of provability logic corresponds to a condition on
frames, as follows:



For all frames 
F
=
⟨
W
,
R
⟩
,
F
⊨
◻
(
◻
p
→
p
)
→
◻
p
 iff 
R
 is transitive and
conversely well-founded. 



Here, 
transitivity
 is the well-known property that for all
worlds 
w
1
, 
w
2
, 
w
3
 in 
W
, if 
w
1
R
w
2
 and 
w
2
R
w
3
, then 
w
1
R
w
3
. A relation is 
conversely
well-founded
 iff there are no infinite ascending sequences, that
is sequences of the form 
w
1
R
w
2
R
w
3
R
…
. Note that
conversely well-founded frames are also irreflexive, for if 
w
R
w
,
this gives rise to an infinite ascending sequence

w
R
w
R
w
R
…
.



The above correspondence result immediately shows that GL is modally
sound with respect to the class of possible worlds models on
transitive conversely well-founded frames, because all axioms and
rules of GL are valid on such models. The question is whether
completeness also holds: for example, the formula 
◻
A
→
◻
◻
A
, which is valid on all transitive frames, is indeed
provable in GL, as was mentioned in
 
Section 1
.
 But is 
every
 formula that is valid on all transitive
conversely well-founded frames also provable in GL?


3.2 Modal completeness



Unaware of the arithmetical significance of GL, K. Segerberg proved in
1971 that GL is indeed complete with respect to transitive conversely
well-founded frames; D. de Jongh and S. Kripke independently proved
this result as well. Segerberg showed that GL is complete even with
respect to the more restricted class of finite transitive irreflexive
trees, a fact which later turned out to be very useful for
Solovay’s proof of the arithmetical completeness theorem (see
 
Section 4
).



The modal soundness and completeness theorems immediately give rise to
a decision procedure to check for any modal formula 
A
 whether

A
 follows from GL or not, by depth-first search through
irreflexive transitive trees of bounded depth. Looking at the
procedure a bit more precisely, it can be shown that GL is decidable
in the computational complexity class PSPACE, like the well-known
modal logics K, T and S4. This means that there is a Turing machine
that, given a formula 
A
 as input, answers whether 
A
 follows
from GL or not; the size of the memory that the Turing machine needs
for its computation is only polynomial in the length of 
A
. One can
show that the decision problem for GL (again, like the decision
problems for K, T and S4) is PSPACE-
complete
, in the sense
that all other problems in PSPACE are no harder than deciding whether
a given formula is a theorem of GL. (See Goré and Kelly 2007
[Other Internet Resources] for the description of an automated theorem
prover for GL.)



To give some more perspective on complexity, the class P of functions
computable in an amount of time polynomial in the length of the input,
is included in PSPACE, which in turn is included in the class EXPTIME
of functions computable in exponential time (see the entry
 
computability and complexity
).
 It remains a famous open problem whether these two inclusions are
strict, although many complexity theorists believe that they are. Some
other well-known modal logics, like epistemic logic with common
knowledge, are decidable in EXPTIME, thus they may be more complex
than GL, depending on the open problems.


3.3 Failure of strong completeness



Many well-known modal logics 
S
 are not only complete with respect
to an appropriate class of frames, but even 
strongly
complete
. In order to explain strong completeness, we need the
notion of 
derivability from a set of assumptions
. A formula

A
 is derivable from the set of assumptions 
Γ
 in a modal
logic 
S
, written as 
Γ
⊢
A
, if 
A
 is in 
Γ

or 
A
 follows from formulas in 
Γ
 and axioms of 
S
 by
applications of Modus Ponens and the Generalization Rule. Here, the
Generalization Rule can only be applied to derivations without
assumptions (see Hakli and Negri 2010).



Now a modal logic 
S
 is 
strongly complete
 if for all
(finite or infinite) sets 
Γ
 and all formulas 
A
:



If, on appropriate 
S
-frames, 
A
 is true in all worlds in which
all formulas of 
Γ
 are true, then 
Γ
⊢
A
 in the
logic 
S
. 



This condition holds for systems like K, M, K4, S4, and S5. If
restricted to finite sets 
Γ
, the above condition corresponds
to completeness.



Strong completeness does not hold for provability logic, however,
because 
semantic compactness
 fails. Semantic compactness is
the property that for each infinite set 
Γ
 of formulas,



If every finite subset 
Δ
 of 
Γ
 has a model on an
appropriate 
S
-frame, then 
Γ
 also has a model on an
appropriate 
S
-frame. 



As a counterexample, take the infinite set of formulas


Γ
=
{
⬦
p
0
,
◻
(
p
0
→
⬦
p
1
)
,
◻
(
p
1
→
⬦
p
2
)
,
◻
(
p
2
→
⬦
p
3
)
,
…
,
 
◻
(
p
n
→
⬦
p
n
+
1
)
,
…
}



Then for every finite subset 
Δ
 of 
Γ
, one can
construct a model on a transitive, conversely well-founded frame and a
world in the model where all formulas of 
Δ
 are true. So by
modal soundness, GL does not prove 
⊥
 from 
Δ
 for any
finite 
Δ
⊆
Γ
, and 
a fortiori
 GL does
not prove 
⊥
 from 
Γ
, as any GL-proof is finite. On the
other hand, it is easy to see that there is no model on a transitive,
conversely well-founded frame where in any world, all formulas of

Γ
 hold. Thus 
⊥
 follows semantically from 
Γ
,
but is not provable from it in GL, contradicting the condition of
strong
 completeness.

3.4 Topological semantics for provability logic



As an alternative to possible worlds semantics, many modal logics may
be given topological semantics. Clearly, propositions can be
interpreted as subsets of a topological space. It is also easy to see
that the propositional connective 
∧
 corresponds to the
set-theoretic operation 
∩
, while 
∨
 corresponds to

∪
, 
¬
 corresponds to the set-theoretic complement, and

→
 corresponds to 
⊆
. Modal logics that
contain the reflection axiom 
◻
A
→
A
 enjoy a
particularly natural interpretation of the modal operators as well.
For these logics, 
⬦
 corresponds to the closure operator in
a topological space, while 
◻
 corresponds to the interior. To
see why these interpretations are appropriate, notice that the
reflection axiom corresponds to the fact that each set is included in
its closure and each set includes its interior.



However, provability logic does 
not
 prove reflection, as the
instantiation 
◻
⊥
→
⊥
 of reflection would lead
to a contradiction with the axiom (GL).



Provability logic therefore needs a different approach. Based on a
suggestion by J. McKinsey and A. Tarski (1944), L. Esakia (1981, 2003)
investigated the interpretation of 
⬦
 as the derived set
operator 
d
, which maps a set 
B
 to the set of its limit points

d
(
B
)
. To explain the consequences of this interpretation of

⬦
, we need two more definitions, namely of the concepts

dense-in-itself
 and 
scattered
. A subset 
B
 of a
topological space is called 
dense-in-itself
 if 
B
⊆
d
(
B
)
. A topological space is called 
scattered
 if it has no
non-empty subset that is dense-in-itself. The ordinals in their
interval topology form examples of scattered spaces. Esakia (1981)
proved an important correspondence: he showed that a topological space

satisfies the axiom GL
 if and only if the space is

scattered
. This correspondence soon led to the result,
independently found by Abashidze (1985) and Blass (1990), that
provability logic is complete with respect to any ordinal 
≥
ω
ω
.



In the previous decades, topological semantics for provability logic
has seen a veritable revival, especially in the study of
Japaridze’s bimodal provability logic GLB, an extension of GL
(Japaridze 1986). The logic GLB turns out to be 
modally
incomplete
 with respect to its possible worlds semantics, in the
sense that it does not correspond to any class of 
frames.
[
3
]

 This feature places bimodal GLB in sharp contrast with unimodal GL,
which corresponds to the class of finite transitive irreflexive trees,
as mentioned above. Beklemishev et al. (2009) showed that GLB is,
however, complete with respect to its 
topological
 semantics
(see also Beklemishev 2009, Icard 2011). Intriguing reverberations of
Esakia’s correspondence between GL and scattered topological
spaces can even be found in topological studies of spatial and
epistemic logics (see Aiello et al. 2007). (See
 
Section 5.4

 for further discussion about GLB).


4. Provability logic and Peano Arithmetic



From the time GL was formulated, researchers wondered whether it was
adequate for formal theories like Peano Arithmetic (PA): does GL prove

everything
 about the notion of provability that can be
expressed in a propositional modal language and can be proved in Peano
Arithmetic, or should more principles be added to GL? To make this
notion of adequacy more precise, we define a 
realization

(sometimes called translation or interpretation) to be a function

f
 that assigns to each propositional atom of modal logic a
sentence of arithmetic, where




f
(
⊥
)
=
⊥
;


f
 respects the logical connectives, for example, 
f
(
B
→
C
)
=
(
f
(
B
)
→
f
(

 and


◻
 is translated as the provability predicate

, so

.




4.1 Arithmetical soundness



It was already clear in the early 1970s that GL is 
arithmetically
sound
 with respect to PA, formally: 


If 
GL
⊢
A
,
then for all realizations 
f
,
PA
⊢
f
(
A
)
.



To give some taste of meta-mathematics, let us sketch the soundness
proof.




Proof sketch of arithmetical soundness
. PA indeed
proves realizations of propositional tautologies, and provability of
the Distribution Axiom of GL translates to


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
→
B
⌝
)
→
(
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
)



for all formulas 
A
 and 
B
, which is just
Löb’s second derivability condition (see
 
Section 1
).
 Moreover, PA obeys Modus Ponens, as well as the translation of the
Generalization Rule:


If 
PA
⊢
A
,
then 
PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
,



which is just Löb’s first derivability condition. Finally,
the translation of the main axiom (GL) is indeed provable in PA:


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
A
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
.



This is exactly the formalized version of Löb’s theorem
mentioned in
 
Section 1
.



Let us give a sketch of the proof of Löb’s theorem itself
from his derivability conditions (the proof of the formalized version
is similar). The proof is based on Gödel’s diagonalization
lemma, which says that for any arithmetical formula 
C
(
x
)
 there is
an arithmetical formula 
B
 such that


PA
⊢
B
↔
C
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
.



In words, the formula 
B
 says “I have property

C
.”




Proof of Löb’s theorem:
. Suppose that

PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
A
; we need to
show that 
PA
⊢
A
. By the diagonalization lemma, there is a
formula 
B
 such that


PA
⊢
B
↔
(
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
A
)
.



From this it follows by Löb’s first and second derivability
conditions plus some propositional reasoning that


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
↔
Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
A
⌝
)
.



Thus, again by Löb’s second condition,


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
(
Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
)
.



On the other hand Löb’s third condition gives


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
⌝
)
,



thus


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
.



Together with the assumption that 
P
A
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
A
⌝
)
→
A
, this gives


PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
→
A
.



Finally, the equation produced by the diagonalization lemma implies
that 
PA
⊢
B
, so 
PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
B
⌝
)
,
thus


PA
⊢
A
,



as desired.



Note that substituting 
⊥
 for 
A
 in Löb’s theorem,
we derive that 
PA
⊢
¬
Prov
(
⌜
⊥
⌝
)

implies 
PA
⊢
⊥
, which is just the contraposition of
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem.


4.2 Arithmetical completeness



The landmark result in provability logic is R. Solovay’s
arithmetical completeness theorem of 1976, showing that GL is indeed
adequate for Peano Arithmetic:


GL
⊢
A
 if and only if for all realizations 
f
,
PA
⊢
f
(
A
)
.



This theorem says essentially that the modal logic GL captures
everything that Peano Arithmetic can truthfully say in modal terms
about its own provability predicate. The direction from left to right,
arithmetical soundness of GL, is discussed above. Solovay set out to
prove the other, much more difficult, direction by contraposition. His
proof is based on intricate self-referential techniques, and only a
small glimpse can be given here.



The modal completeness theorem by Segerberg was an important first
step in Solovay’s proof of arithmetical completeness of GL with
respect to Peano Arithmetic. Suppose that GL does not prove the modal
formula 
A
. Then, by modal completeness, there is a finite
transitive irreflexive tree such that 
A
 is false at the root of
that tree. Now Solovay devised an ingenious way to simulate such a
finite tree in the language of Peano Arithmetic. Thus he found a
realization 
f
 from modal formulas to sentences of arithmetic, such
that Peano Arithmetic does not prove 
f
(
A
)
.



Solovay’s completeness theorem provides an alternative way to
construct many arithmetical sentences that are not provable in Peano
Arithmetic. For example, it is easy to make a possible worlds model to
show that GL does not prove 
◻
p
∨
◻
¬
p
, so by
Solovay’s theorem, there is an arithmetical sentence 
f
(
p
)

such that Peano Arithmetic does not prove 
Prov
(
⌜
f
(
p
)
⌝
)
∨
Prov
(
⌜
¬
f
(
p
)
⌝
)
. In
particular, this implies that neither 
f
(
p
)
 nor 
¬
f
(
p
)
 is
provable in Peano Arithmetic; for suppose on the contrary that 
PA
⊢
f
(
p
)
, then by Löb’s first condition and
propositional logic, 
PA
⊢
Prov
(
⌜
f
(
p
)
⌝
)
∨
Prov
(
⌜
¬
f
(
p
)
⌝
)
, leading to a contradiction,
and similarly if one supposes that 
PA
⊢
¬
f
(
p
)
.



Solovay’s theorem is so significant because it shows that an
interesting fragment of an undecidable formal theory like Peano
Arithmetic—namely that which arithmetic can express in
propositional terms about its own provability predicate—can be
studied by means of a decidable modal logic, GL, with a perspicuous
possible worlds semantics.


5. The scope of provability logic



In this section, some trends in research on provability logic are
discussed. One important strand concerns the limits on the scope of
GL, where the main question is, for which formal theories, other than
Peano Arithmetic, is GL the appropriate propositional provability
logic? Next, we discuss some generalizations of propositional
provability logic in more expressive modal languages.


5.1 Boundaries



Since the late 1980s, logicians have investigated many other systems
of arithmetic that are weaker than Peano Arithmetic. Often these
logicians took their inspiration from computability issues, for
example the study of functions computable in polynomial time. They
have given a partial answer to the question: “For which theories
of arithmetic does Solovay’s arithmetical completeness theorem
(with respect to the appropriate provability predicate) still
hold?” To discuss this question, two concepts are needed.

Δ
0
-formulas are arithmetical formulas in which all
quantifiers are bounded by a term, for example


∀
y
≤
s
s
0
∀
z
≤
y
∀
x
≤
y
+
z
(
x
+
y
≤
(
y
+
(
y
+
z
)
)
)
,



where 
s
 is the successor operator (“
+
1
”). The
arithmetical theory 
I
Δ
0
 (where I stands for
“induction”), is similar to Peano Arithmetic, except that
it allows less induction: the induction scheme


A
(
0
)
∧
∀
x
(
A
(
x
)
→
A
(
s
x
)
)
→
∀
x
A
(
x
)



is restricted to 
Δ
0
-formulas 
A
.



As De Jongh and others (1991) pointed out, arithmetical completeness
certainly holds for theories 
T
 that satisfy the following two
conditions:




T
 proves induction for 
Δ
0
-formulas, and 
T
 proves
EXP, the formula expressing that for all 
x
, its power 
2
x

exists. In more standard notation: 
T
 extends 
I
Δ
0
+EXP;


T
 does not prove any false sentences of the form 
∃
x
A
(
x
)
, with 
A
(
x
)
 a 
Δ
0
-formula.





For such theories, arithmetical soundness and completeness of GL hold,
provided that 
◻
 translates to 
Prov
T
, a natural
provability predicate with respect to a sufficiently simple
axiomatization of 
T
. Thus for modal sentences 
A
:


GL
⊢
A
 if and only if for all realizations 
f
,
T
⊢
f
(
A
)
.



It is not clear yet whether Condition 1 gives a lower bound on the
scope of provability logic. For example, it is still an open question
whether GL is the provability logic of 
I
Δ
0
+
Ω
1
, a
theory which is somewhat weaker than 
I
Δ
0
+EXP in that

Ω
1
 is the axiom asserting that for all 
x
, its power

x
log
(
x
)
 exists. Provability logic GL is arithmetically sound
with respect to 
I
Δ
0
+
Ω
1
, but except for some partial
results by Berarducci and Verbrugge (1993), providing arithmetic
realizations consistent with 
I
Δ
0
+
Ω
1
 for a restricted
class of sentences consistent with GL, the question remains open. Its
answer may hinge on open problems in computational complexity
theory.



The above result by De Jongh et al. shows a strong feature of
provability logic: for many different arithmetical theories, GL
captures exactly what those theories say about their own provability
predicates. At the same time this is a weakness. For example,
propositional provability logic does not point to any differences
between those theories that are finitely axiomatizable and those that
are not.


5.2 Interpretability logic



In order to be able to speak in a modal language about important
distinctions between theories, researchers have extended provability
logic in many different ways. Let us mention a few. One extension is
to add a binary modality 
⊳
, where for a given
arithmetical theory 
T
, the modal sentence 
A
⊳
B
 is
meant to stand for “
T
+
B
 is interpretable in 
T
+
A
”
(Švejdar, 1983). De Jongh and Veltman (1990) investigated modal
semantics for several interpretability logics, while De Jongh and
Visser (1991) proved the explicit fixed-point property for the most
important ones. Visser characterized the interpretability logic of the
most common finitely axiomatized theories, and Berarducci and
Shavrukov independently characterized the one for PA, which is not
finitely axiomatizable. It appears that indeed, the interpretability
logic of finitely axiomatizable theories is different from the
interpretability logic of Peano Arithmetic (see Montagna 1987; Visser
1990, 1998; Berarducci 1990, Shavrukov 1988; Joosten and Visser
2000).


5.3 Propositional quantifiers



Another way to extend the framework of propositional provability logic
is to add propositional quantifiers, so that one can express
principles like Goldfarb’s:


∀
p
∀
q
∃
r
◻
(
(
◻
p
∨
◻
q
)
↔
◻
r
)
,



saying that for any two sentences there is a third sentence which is
provable if and only if either of the first two sentences is provable.
This principle is provable in Peano Arithmetic (see e.g. Artemov and
Beklemishev 1993). The set of sentences of GL with propositional
quantifiers that is arithmetically valid turns out to be undecidable
(Shavrukov 1997).


5.4 Japaridze’s bimodal and polymodal provability logics



Japaridze’s (1988) bimodal logic GLB has two 
◻
-like
provability operators, denoted by 
[
0
]
 and 
[
1
]
, with their dual

⬦
-like operators 
⟨
0
⟩
 and 
⟨
1
⟩
, respectively. In Japaridze’s interpretation, one can
think of 
[
0
]
 as standing for the standard provability predicate in
Peano Arithmetic. On the other hand, 
[
1
]
 corresponds to a stronger
provability predicate, namely 
ω
-
provabilty
. 



Let us define the concepts that are needed to understand this intended
interpretation of GLB. An arithmetical theory 
T
 is defined to be

ω
-
consistent
 if and only if for all formulas A with
free variable 
x
, 
T
⊢
¬
A
(
I
n
)
 for all 
n
 implies
that 
T
⊬
∃
x
A
(
x
)
; here, 
I
n
 is the numeral
of 
n
, i.e., the term 
s
s
…
s
0
 with 
n
 occurrences
of the successor operator 
s
. Peano Arithmetic (PA) is the most
well-known example of an 
ω
-consistent theory (see also
 
Gödel’s incompleteness theorems
).
 Now let PA
+
 be the arithmetical theory whose axioms are those of
PA together with all sentences 
∀
x
¬
A
(
x
)
 such that
for every 
n
, PA
⊢
¬
A
(
I
n
)
. Now

ω
-provability is simply provability in PA
+
, so it is the
dual of 
ω
-consistency.



Japaridze’s bimodal provability logic GLB can be axiomatized by
the axioms and rules of GL (see
 
Section 2
),
 formulated separately for [0] and [1]. In addition, GLB has two mixed
axioms, namely: 

[
0
]
A
→
[
1
]
A


⟨
0
⟩
A
→
[
1
]
⟨
0
⟩
A

 Japaridze’s logic is
decidable and has a reasonable Kripke semantics, and it is
arithmetically sound and complete with respect to Peano Arithmetic
(Japaridze 1988, Boolos 1993).



A polymodal analogue of Japaridze’s GLB, named GLP, has received
a lot of attention in recent years. GLP has infinitely many

◻
-like provability operators, denoted by boxes 
[
n
]
 for
every natural number 
n
, with their dual 
⬦
-like
operators 
⟨
n
⟩
. Again, one can think of 
[
0
]
 as
standing for the standard provability predicate in Peano Arithmetic,

⟨
1
⟩
 for 
ω
-provability, etcetera. GLP has
been axiomatized by starting from the axioms and rules of GL (see
 
Section 2
),
 formulated separately for each 
[
n
]
. In addition, GLP has three
mixed axiom schemes, namely, as formulated by Beklemishev (2010):


[
m
]
A
→
[
n
]
A
,
 for 
m
≤
n


⟨
k
⟩
A
→
[
n
]
⟨
k
⟩
A
,
 for 
k
<
n


[
m
]
A
→
[
n
]
[
m
]
A
,
 for 
m
≤
n





GLP has been endowed with a Kripke semantics with respect to which it
is complete, and has also been shown to be arithmetically complete
with respect to Peano Arithmetic (see Beklemishev 2010a, 2011a). Just
like for GL, the decision problem for GLP is PSPACE-complete
(Shapirovsky 2008), while its closed fragment is polynomial time
decidable (Pakhomov 2014).



Over the last three decades, a number of results have been proved
about the polymodal logic GLP of strong provability predicates. Here
follow some particularly fruitful topics:




the closed fragment of GLP (see Ignatiev 1993; Beklemishev,
Joosten and Vervoort 2005);


 GLP and proof-theoretic ordinals (Beklemishev 2004);


 Neighbourhood semantics for GLP (Shamkanov 2020);


 Interpolation theorems for GLP (see Beklemishev 2010b, Shamkanov
2011);


 The relationship between topological semantics and set theory,
among others particular large cardinal axioms and stationary
reflection (see Beklemishev 2011b; Beklemishev and Gabelaia 2013,
2014; Fernández-Duque 2014; Aguilera and Fernández-Duque
2017).




5.5 Predicate provability logic



Finally, one can of course study predicate provability logic. The
language is that of predicate logic without function symbols, together
with the operator 
◻
. Here, the situation becomes much more
complex than in the case of propositional provability logic. To begin
with, the straightforward quantified version of GL does not have the
fixed-point property, is not complete with respect to any class of
Kripke frames, and is not arithmetically complete with respect to
Peano Arithmetic (Montagna, 1984; see Rybakov 2023 for recent
generalizations). The question then arises: Is there any nicely
axiomatized predicate provability logic that is adequate, proving
exactly the valid principles of provability? The answer is
unfortunately a resounding no: Vardanyan (1986) has proved on the
basis of ideas by Artemov (1985a) that the set of sentences of
predicate provability logic all of whose realizations are provable in
PA is not even recursively enumerable but 
Π
0
2
-complete, so it
has no reasonable axiomatization. Visser and De Jonge (2006) showed
that there is no escape from Vardanyan’s theorem by proving a
generalization: For a wide range of arithmetical theories 
T
, the
set of sentences of predicate provability logic all of whose
realizations are provable in 
T
 turns out to be

Π
0
2
-complete as well. Recently, however, Borges and Joosten
(2020, 2022) showed that a fragment of predicate provability logic
based on a strictly positive language containing the propositional
connective 
∧
, the modal operator 
⬦
, and the
quantifier 
∀
 is arithmetically complete and still
decidable.


5.6 Other generalizations



Left out in the above discussion are many other important strands of
research in provability logic and its extensions. The interested
reader is pointed to the following areas: 




the provability logic of intuitionistic arithmetic (see Troelstra
1973; Visser 1982, 1999, 2002, 2008; Iemhoff 2000, 2001, 2003;

1979, Švejdar 1983, Montagna 1992);

operators for different theories (see Carlson 1986; Smoryński
1985; Beklemishev 1994, 1996; Visser 1995);


provability logics for standard provability combined with unusual
provability predicates externally enumerating PA, such as
Feferman’s and Parikh’s provability predicates and slow
provability predicates (see Feferman 1960; Parikh 1971; Montagna 1978;
Visser 1989; Carbone and Montagna 1990; Shavrukov 1994; Lindström
1994, 2006; Henk and Pakhomov 2016 (Other Internet Resources));

Montagna 1994; Yavorskaya 2001; Artemov and Iemhoff 2007; Kuznets and
Studer 2019);


correspondence between provability logic and
 
justification logic
s
 (see Artemov and Nogina 2005; Shamkanov 2016 (Other Internet
Resources); Fitting 2020); 


relevant provability logic based on the
 
relevance logic

 R (see Mares 2000);


applications of provability logic in proof theory (see Beklemishev
1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006);


proof theory of propositional modal logics closely related to the
provability logic GL, namely, Grzegorczyk logic (Grz) and weak
Grezgorczyk logic (wGrz) (see Litak 2007; Maksimova 2014; Goré
and Ramanayake 2014; Dyckhoff and Negri 2016; Savateev and Shamkanov
2019, 2021);


positive provability logics and reflection calculus (see
Beklemishev 2012, 2014, 2018a, 2018b; Dashkov 2012);


generalizations of the polymodal provability logic GLP, namely
provability logics with transfinitely many modalities (see Beklemishev
et al. 2014; Fernández-Duque and Joosten 2013a, 2013b, 2014,
2018; Joosten 2021; Beklemishev and Pakhomov 2022);


relations between provability logic and the 
μ
-calculus (see
van Benthem 2006, Visser 2005, Alberucci and Facchini 2009); and


provability algebras, also called diagonalizable algebras or
Magari algebras (see Magari 1975a, 1975b; Montagna 1979, 1980a, 1980b;
Bernardi and D’Aquino 1988; Shavrukov 1993a, 1993b, 1997;
Zambella 1994; for recent results on their elementary theories, see
Pakhomov 2012, 2014a (Other Internet Resources), 2015. 





For the reader who would like to contribute to the area of provability
logic and its generalizations, Beklemishev and Visser (2006) have
proposed an annotated list of intriguing open problems.


6. Philosophical significance



Even though propositional provability logic is a modal logic with a
kind of “necessity” operator, it withstands Quine’s
(1976) controversial critique of modal notions as unintelligible,
already because of its clear and unambiguous arithmetic
interpretation. For example, unlike for many other modal logics,
formulas with nested modalities like 
◻
⬦
p
→
◻
⊥
 are not problematic, nor are there any disputes about which
ones should be tautologies. In fact, provability logic embodies all
the desiderata that Quine (1953) set out for syntactic treatments of
modality.



Quine’s main arrows were pointed towards modal predicate logics,
especially the construction of sentences that contain modal operators
under the scope of quantifiers (“quantifying in”). In
predicate provability logic, however, where quantifiers range over
natural numbers, both 
de dicto
 and 
de re
 modalities
have straightforward interpretations, contrary to the case of other
modal logics (see the note on the
 
de dicto
 / 
de re
 distinction
).
 For example, formulas like


∀
x
◻
∃
y
(
y
=
x
)



are not at all problematic. If the number 
n
 is assigned to 
x
,
then 
◻
∃
y
(
y
=
x
)
 is true with respect to this
assignment iff the sentence 
∃
y
(
y
=
I
n
)
 is provable in
Peano Arithmetic; here, 
I
n
 is the numeral of 
n
, i.e., the
term 
s
s
…
s
0
 with 
n
 occurrences of the successor
operator 
s
. This sentence is true for all 
n
 in the standard
model of the natural numbers, and 
∀
x
◻
∃
y
(
y
=
x
)
 is even provable in Peano Arithmetic.



By the way, the Barcan Formula


∀
x
◻
A
(
x
)
→
◻
∀
x
A
(
x
)



is not true for the integers, let alone provable (for example, take
for 
A
(
x
)
 the formula “
x
 does not code a proof of

⊥
”). Its converse 


◻
∀
x
A
(
x
)
→
∀
x
◻
A
(
x
)



on the other hand, is provable in Peano Arithmetic for any formula

A
. 



Provability logic has very different principles from other modal
logics, even those with a seemingly similar purpose. For example,
while provability logic captures provability in formal theories of
arithmetic,
 
epistemic logic

 endeavors to describe knowledge, which could be viewed as a kind of
informal provability. In many versions of epistemic logic, one of the
most important principles is the truth axiom (5):


S5
⊢
◻
A
→
A
,
(
if one knows 
A
,
 then 
A
 is true
)
.



The analogous principle clearly does not hold for GL: after all, 


if 
GL
⊢
◻
A
→
A
,
 then 
GL
⊢
A
.



Thus, it seems misguided to compare the strength of both notions or to
combine them in one modal system. 



Since the 1940s, there has been a lot of interest among philosophers
of mathematics in the concept of informal provability or 
absolute
provability
 (Gödel 1946, Kreisel 1967), including
controversies about its proper definition (see Leach-Krouse 2013;
Kennedy 2014; Crocco 2019; for good discussions of these
controversies). Williamson (2016) gives the following definition:
“A mathematical hypothesis is 
absolutely provable
 if
and only if it can in principle be known by a normal mathematical
process.”. At any rate, it is clear that the concept of absolute
provability is very different from the concept of 
formal
provability
 in a given formal system, which is the central notion
in the rest of this article on provability logic. 



Related to the concept of absolutely provable statements is that of

absolutely undecidable statements
, namely, those statements

A
 for which neither 
A
 nor 
¬
A
 is absolutely provable.
An interesting question is whether Gödel’s Disjunction
holds: Is it the case that either “the mind cannot be mechanized
” or “there are absolutely undecidable statements”?
Fascinating takes on this question can be found in (Koellner 2016,
Leach-Krouse 2016, Williamson 2016).



Discussions of the consequences of Gödel’s incompleteness
theorems sometimes involve confusion around the notion of provability,
giving rise to claims that humans could beat formal systems in
“knowing” theorems; see (Davis 1990, 1993; Franzén
1995; Lindström 2001) for good critical discussions of such
claims.



All in all, formal provability is a precisely defined concept, much
more so than truth and knowledge. Thus,
 
self-reference

 within the scope of provability does not lead to semantic paradoxes
like the Liar. Instead, it has led to some of the most important
results about mathematics, such as Gödel’s incompleteness
theorems.

Acknowledgments



I would like to express my immense gratitude to Lev Beklemishev, who
was so kind as to write me a long letter in 2017, including many
literature references to developments in provability logic as seen
from his perspective. Thanks are also due to Albert Visser, Sara
Uckelman, Rajeev Goré, Giovanni Sambin, Vítězslav
Švejdar, Sara Negri, Joost Joosten, Ian Shillito, Wesley
Holliday, Revantha Ramanayake, Anupam Das, Shawn Standefer, Toby
Meadows, Edson Bezerra, Nils Kürbis, and Tadeusz Litak for their
suggestions of improvements and additions to the 2017 and/or 2024
versions of this article.



This 2024 version of the article on provability logic is dedicated to
the memory of three Nestors of provability logic and the
meta-mathematics of first-order arithmetic: Franco Montagna
(1948–2015), Sol Feferman (1928–2016), and Petr Hájek
(1940–2016).
