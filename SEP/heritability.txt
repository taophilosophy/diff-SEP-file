A heritable trait is most simply an offspring’s trait that
resembles the parents’ corresponding trait more than it
resembles the same trait in a random individual in the population.
Inheritance or heredity was a focus of systematic research before its
inclusion as a key concept within evolutionary theory. The systematic
study of heredity in the 20
th
 century focused on the gene
as the unit of heredity. (There is a vast amount of helpful work on
the history of heredity including Keller (2002), Griesemer (1994),
Morange (1998), Moss (2003), Sapp (2003), Sarkar (1998), Wade (1992),
Winther (2000; 2001) and contributors to Buerton et al. (eds.)
(2000).) Two traditions now dominate the study of heredity: population
genetics and molecular biology. The notion of a quantitative measure
of the heritability of any given trait comes from population genetics
and heritability measures are commonly used in behavioral genetics
(Plomin et al. 1990 and Plomin et al. 1997 and see Panofsky 2014,
Tabery 2014, Taylor 2014 and Turkheimer 2000 for critical reflection
on behavioral genetics and heritability analysis). The idea that what
is inherited is a stock of DNA, or the information contained in the
DNA sequence, comes from molecular biology.



Philosophical discussions of heredity have predominantly focused on
the sustainability of heritability analyses. Here we introduce the
concept of heritability, its theoretical history, alternate approaches
to determining the heritability of traits and the philosophical
problems associated with these alternate approaches.

1. Terminological issues



The term “heritable” applies to traits that vary in the
population and are more similar in parents and offspring than they are
in randomly selected individuals in the population. We inherit
numerous attributes from our parents including their religious beliefs
and, if we are lucky, their vast fortunes. The kinds of hereditary
traits that biologists are interested in are those that are reliably
transmitted from one generation to the next as a matter of biology.
Darwin (1859 [1968]), working without the advantages that genetics
would later bring, discussed hereditary traits at the level of
phenotypes. Darwin demonstrated that natural selection sorts among
hereditary variations, for example, the height of an organism, its
weight, the color of its coat and so on. Most contemporary discussions
of heredity constrain hereditary traits to those that can be
demonstrated to be passed on genetically. The concept of
“heritability” was introduced “to quantify the level
of predictability of passage of a biologically interesting phenotype
from parent to offspring” (Feldman, 151). Heritability is
usually assessed by complex statistical analysis, careful
experimentation, or both.



Discussions of heredity invite confusions between mechanisms
responsible for individual development and mechanisms responsible for
the transmission of traits from one generation to the next. Genes are
the standard units of inheritance discussed in biology. Genes are also
taken to be the most important causal component in the development of
an organism’s traits. Methods derived from population genetics
to assess heritability provide no information about the causal
mechanisms contributing to the development of an individual’s
traits. Population geneticists study the patterns of transmission of
traits in populations from one generation to the next. Molecular
biologists identify coding sequences of DNA and hence the proteins
that these sequences produce in the developing organism. Working
together, molecular biologists and population geneticists can produce
a convergent account of a particular gene, providing both its pattern
of transmission and an account of its role in development. For
example, medical geneticists may discover a pattern of inheritance for
a disease in a family that leads them to hypothesize that there is a
gene (or a number of genes) responsible for the development of the
trait in individual humans. Molecular analysis may then lead to the
discovery of a sequence of DNA that codes for an unusual protein that
is in part responsible for the development of the symptoms of the
disease. Finally, population genetics techniques, such as heritability
analysis, may then be applied to mechanisms discovered by molecular
biologists (See e.g. Visscher et al. 2008).


2. Heritability and Population Genetics



Mendelian genetics provides laws that govern the passing on of
discrete traits from one generation to the next. For example, Mendel
experimentally demonstrated particular patterns of inheritance for
smooth and wrinkled peas in a population of pea plants (See Olby 1979
for a discussion of Mendel’s own specific contributions to
genetics and Kampourakis 2024 and Raddick 2022 for reflections on
Mendel’s contributions and how we should understand them in the
context of contemporary genetics.). Discrete or discontinuous traits
contrast with continuous or quantitative traits. Height in humans and
leaf number in trees are continuous traits. Continuous traits vary on
a continuum that can be represented as a normal distribution, graphed
as a bell curve. Most philosophical discussion about heredity and
heritability arises from the study of continuous traits.



The study of quantitative or continuous traits can be carried out by
looking simply at phenotypes. For example, if a population of plants
varies in height we can ask how much of this variation is due to
genes. Assessing the proportion of the variation of a trait in a
population that is due to genes is achieved by a statistical method
called the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Once this analysis has been
carried out a simple formula provides a number between 0 and 1 that is
the heritability measure for the trait in question. We use a few
simple examples to illustrate the important concepts involved in
producing heritability measures.



Before we consider the analysis of variance and its contribution to
heritability measures, it is helpful to understand the general concept
of heritability. Heritability is taken to be a measure of genetic
influence on variation by both behavior geneticists and animal
breeders. On this account, if a trait has high heritability, its
varying from individual to individual in a population can be explained
genetically. Plomin (2018) and other behavior geneticists adopt this
account, whereas Schaffner proposes a weaker construal:
“Heritability estimates […] are meant to indicate how
much of the phenotypic variation in the population is due to genetic
variation” (2016, 10)(See also Longino, 2013.) An imaginary
example illustrates one way of assessing heritability. Say we have two
students from a class and student 
a
 is 6′2″ and
student 
b
 is 4′2″. To discover the influence of
genes on height, we could clone both students and then swap the
clones’ environments and see what happens. In the figure below,
the environments that 
a
 and 
b
 grew up in are 
E
a
 and 
E
b
. Clones of 
a
 and 
b
 are

A scenario like 2 is the most likely outcome. Of course we can’t
clone humans (or faithfully replicate the environments they grow up
in). We can, however, do this with plants and other kinds of
experimental organisms and as a result we can get a good sense of the
contribution of genes to variation in a phenotypic trait.



Heritability can be estimated in humans by comparing resemblance in
the phenotypic traits of twins (See Section 4. For a more detailed
discussion of twin studies.) or other pairings of genetically related
individuals (e.g. siblings, parents, cousins, etc.). Twin studies make
the following assumptions: Monozygotic, (identical), twins share all
their genes and their environment but dizygotic, (fraternal), twins
share half their genes and their environment. For any given trait, say
height, we get the following results:



a) If heritability is high and variation is due mostly to genes, then
monozygotic twins will be closer in height than fraternal twins.




b) If heritability is low and variation in height is due mostly to the
environment, then monozygotic twins will be as different in height
from one another as dizygotic twins.




Finally, we can get a sense of the heritability of a trait by finding
the slope of the regression line on the plots of offspring value for a
trait graphed with parental value. If the slope is 1, the trait is
entirely genetic and if the slope is 0, then the trait is not genetic
at all. If the variation among individuals is due to variation in
their genes, then offspring ought to resemble their parents.
Heritability is always a value between 1 and 0. In the graph below
(Figure 2.) values for mid-parent height and mid-offspring height are
plotted for a small sample population (mid-parent height is the
average of the height of both parents). The slope of the regression
line is .75, which indicates high heritability. (It should be stressed
that this is a very informal presentation of this kind of estimation
of heritability and for this approach to provide any useful results
important constraints on the nature of the population and the relevant
environment would have to be satisfied.)








Figure 2.





So far we have introduced methods of measuring or calculating
heritability that are somewhat intuitive. The problem is that these
methods do not acknowledge all that is involved in the production of
variation in the quantitative traits of organisms in a population. If
we stick to the example of variation in height in a sample population
of humans, we will discover that in most representative samples,
heights are distributed more or less normally. The variance in height
is defined as the average of the squared difference between each
measured height and the mean height for the population. Variance in
phenotype or phenotypic variance is symbolized as 
V
P
. (From here
until the end of this section we adopt a specific strategy for
presenting the equations used in spelling out heritability relations.
We start out, with equation (1) below, by presenting the simplest
version of the relevant equations. Simple equations such as (1) below
are rarely ever satisfied but are routinely presented as adequate in
elementary introductions to behavioral genetics. Subsequent equations
in the sequence below render the relevant situation more accurately.
Population geneticists endorse variants of (1′) below and do not
endorse (1).)




V
P

V
G

V
E





Equation (1) simply says that the phenotypic variance is the variance
due to genes plus the variance due to the organisms’
environment. Behavioral geneticists and psychologists introduce
heritability in the following way: Heritability is the proportion of
phenotypic variance that is attributable to genotypic variance:
heritability 
=
V
G
⁄
V
P
 (Some also talk of
“environmentability”, which is 
V
E
⁄
V
P
.)



This notion of heritability is called broad sense heritability,

h
2
b
 , and is “the proportion of phenotypic differences due
to all sources of genetic variance” (Plomin 1990, 234). Narrow
sense heritability, 
h
2
, is “the proportion of phenotypic
variance due solely to additive genetic variance” (Plomin 1990,
234).

“Additive genetic variation 
(
V
A
)
 is variation among
individuals due to the additive effects of genes” (Freeman and
Heron, 206). For example, variation in height of organisms could
result from the contribution of several alleles at a locus where each
allele contributes more height to the organism. More precisely, allele

A
 could contribute .5 units to an organism’s height,
allele 
a
 another .5 units and so on. A contrast with additive
genetic variance is dominance variance 
(
V
D
)
. In this case, say
two alleles (
A
 and 
a
) are responsible for the
organism’s height. An organism with 
aa
 is 1.0 units
high, an organism with 
AA
 is 2.0 units high but an organism
with 
Aa
 is also 2.0 units high. Total genetic variance,

V
G
, is actually the sum of all the genetic variance. In the
simplified case presented here this is




V
G
=
V
A
+
V
D





The implied equation for 
V
P
 from the discussion so far is




V
P
=
V
A
+
V
D
+
V
E





But this equation still oversimplifies the situation and requires more
refining to deal with quantitative traits. Variance in phenotype can
result from gene interaction effects, or epistatic variance,

V
I
. This occurs when alleles at one locus have an effect on the
phenotype that is dependent upon alleles at one or more other loci.
Further, there may be a contribution to phenotypic variance from
gene/environment interaction, 
V
G
×
E
 (See Tabery 2014 for a
detailed discussion of gene/environment interaction.). This occurs
when the effect of the environment on the phenotype differs between
genotypes. Finally, 
V
P
 can be affected by non-random correlations
between genotypes and environments referred to as gene-environment
covariation, 
C
O
V
(
G
,
E
)
. For example, if plants with a genotype
that tends to produce large plants also select nutrient- rich
environments, by root growth or seed dispersal, and plants with a
genotype that tends to produce small plants also select nutrient- poor
environments, the variance in height would be increased. If the
relation were switched the variance would decrease (Futuyma 1998).
Factoring all the above in we now have the following:




V
P
=
V
A

V
D
+
V
I
+
V
E
+
V
G

+
C
O
V
(
G
,
E
)





And




V
G
=
V
A
+
V
D
+
V
I





The assumption made by many evolutionary biologists is that 
V
I
,
V
G
×
E
 and 
C
O
V
(
G
,
E
)
 are generally small and the most
important component of variance from an evolutionary standpoint is

V
A
. Evolutionary biologists, psychologists and behavior
geneticists are all interested in 
h
2
(
=
V
A
⁄
V
P
)
 but for
different reasons. Psychologists and behavior geneticists are
interested in the contribution of genes to human psychological traits
whereas evolutionary biologists (and animal breeders) often use
heritability measures to predict and measure the response of a trait
to selection (See Lynch and Walsh 1998, 50). The relevant equation
here is




h
2
=
R
S





where, 
R
 is response to selection and 
S
 is the
selection differential. Heritability in this context is referred to as
realized heritability.



Philosophical discussion over measuring heritability has arisen mostly
from the use of 
h
2
 measures in behavioral genetics and
psychology. Much of this discussion takes off from a paper by Lewontin
(1974) in which he argues that the analysis of variance cannot provide
us with answers to questions about how much genes contribute to
variance in a given trait. Before we turn to this and related
discussions, we provide more detail on how heritability is measured in
humans.


3. Measuring heritability: From Galton to GWAS



Francis Galton promoted a version of Darwin’s account of
inheritance that clearly identified an internal, material contribution
to hereditary traits. He proposed the distinction between nature and
nurture, arguing that traits due to nature were the products of
inherited biological material. He also was the first to propose the
study of human twins as a way of understanding the contribution of
nature, as opposed to nurture, to human traits (Burbridge 2001; see
also Kronfeldner 2018). Galton’s early work set the basis for a
paradigm in behavior genetics: twin and family studies. In studies of
plants and other organisms, genetic makeup and environment can be
systematically varied to assess the relative impact of genes and
environment on phenotypic traits. Twin studies are human behavioral
geneticists’ analogue to such experiments (See Shaffner 2016).
By tracking similarities and differences between groups of genetically
related individuals reared in similar environments, twin and family
studies permit some scientific investigation into sources of variance
attributable to genetics and environment. Downes and Turkheimer (2021)
lay out some of the early history of twin studies that long predate
the use of the ACE model. Twin researchers, such as Holzinger had a
measure they originally labeled 
t
2
, which “measures the
relative influence of A [nature] to B [nurture] factors in producing
differentiation” (Holzinger 1929, 247). Holzinger and colleagues
(See e.g. Newman et al. 1937, 115) turned to using 
h
2
 instead of

t
2
 but did not call their measure heritability (their 
t
2

provided measures in numbers above zero and 
h
2
 provided measures
between 0 and 1). They used a similar equation to
“Falconer’s formula” (discussed below) to generate
their 
h
2
.



The predominant tool for twin studies practitioners since the late
1970’s is the statistical ‘ACE model’ (Figure
3.).








Figure 3.





The ACE model is a factor analytic model that partitions phenotypic
variance (represented with boxes) into three latent components
(represented with circles). The first latent factor, ‘A’
represents ‘additive’ genetic variance and captures
genetic similarities and dissimilarities between twin pairs, as
monozygotic (MZ) ‘identical’ twins share roughly 100% of
their DNA while dizygotic (DZ) ‘fraternal’ twins share
roughly 50% of their DNA, just like normal siblings. The component
‘
C
’ represents ‘common’ environment,
signifying environmental variance that is shared by twin pairs reared
together. For example, because both MZ and DZ twin pairs live in the
same home, the correlation between their shared environment equals 1.
Finally, ‘
E
’ represents ‘unique’ or
non-shared environmental variance, capturing environmental variables
that vary between twin pairs. In effect, it is the environmental
variation that is not shared by twins outside the home which ends up
getting couched as ‘
E
’, as is the case when twins
attend different institutions or undergo different life events.



The ACE model, depicted in Figure 3., is a visual
representation—in the form of a path analysis—of the
underlying mathematics of heritability estimation, known as
‘Falconer’s formula’ (Falconer and McKay 1998).
(Interestingly, Falconer himself introduced this idea informally and
then rejected it as an inadequate way of estimating heritability on
the grounds that it ignored non-additive genetic variance, which he
thought to be an unreasonable assumption (Falconer 1960) (See Downes
and Turkheimer 2021).) The formula is derived from an observed
population statistic: the phenotypic correlation between pairs of MZ
and DZ twins. For any phenotype the MZ correlation or
‘
r
MZ
’ is typically higher than the DZ correlation
or ‘
r
DZ
’. Perhaps unsurprisingly, genetically
identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. The implication
is that the greater the genetic similarity, the greater the phenotypic
similarity. Thus, narrow-sense, quantitative genetic heritability is
intuitively defined as the 
difference
 between MZ and DZ
correlations: the greater the difference, the higher the heritability.
On the flip side, if there is minimal difference between MZ and DZ
correlations, it would imply that genetics have little to do with
variance in the trait in question, and result in a low heritability
estimate.



Falconer’s formula starts from the simple observation that MZ
twin pairs share two of the three components in common: 100% of their
genes and 100% of their common environment. Thus, MZ correlation are
treated as the sum of A and C:




r
MZ
=
A
+
C





Similarly, DZ twin pares share 100% of their common environment, but
only half their genetic relatedness. Thus, the DZ correlation is the
sum of half additive genetic variance and common environment:




r
DZ
=
A
2
+
C





Here is Falconer’s formula for heritability estimation, which
calculates the difference between MZ and DZ correlations:




A
=
2
(
r
MZ
−
r
DZ
)





And here is the formula for estimating shared environment
(
C
):




C
=
2
r
DZ
−
r
MZ





Finally, non-shared environment may be derived from the assumption
that genetic similarity, shared environment, and non-shared
environment comprise the total variance in an observed trait,
giving:




E
=
1
−
r
MZ





Consider the following example. In a twin study, one conducts a study
of height, revealing that 
r
MZ
=
.95
 and 
r
DZ
=
.55
.

With this information, the basic techniques of quantitative genetics
may be used to partition said variance into sources attributable to
shared genetics or environments. Starting with heritability:




A
=
2
(
r
MZ
−
r
DZ
)
A
=
2
(
.95
−
.55
)
A
=
2
(
.4
)
A
=
.8





Although philosophically contentious (for reasons discussed below),
the outcome above suggests that 80% of the variance in height in the
studied population of twins reared together is attributable to genetic
differences. To estimate non-shared environment (
C
), recall
the formula derived earlier:




C
=
2
r
DZ
−
r
MZ
C
=
2
(
.55
)
−
.95
C
=
.15





Finally, total variance in height attributable to non-shared
environment:




E
=
1
−
r
MZ
E
=
1
−
.95
E
=
.05





In this example, 80% of the variance in height is attributable to
additive genetics (
A
 = .8), 15% to shared environment
(
C
 = .15), and 5% to non-shared environment (
E
 =
.05).



Research on heritability is currently undergoing a major transition.
For nearly a century, heritability has been estimated in the
‘traditional’ sense, through twin and family studies,
which are silent with respect to the underlying biological units of
genetic transmission. Twin and family studies and the ACE model, that
is, proceed from coarse-grained assumptions about genetic relatedness:
MZ twin share roughly 100% of their genetic material, DZ just half. It
wasn’t until Watson and Crick’s co-discovery of the double
helical model of DNA that geneticists could refine heritability
estimation with attention to biological details. Too much has happened
since the discovery of DNA to detail here, such as linkage analysis
and candidate gene studies, but a few key developments are integral to
understanding the most recent approaches to estimating
heritability.



First, all modern approaches to heritability estimation are
constructed from empirical data on single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). In effect, SNPs are the fundamental units of genetic
differences that occur between individuals and are assumed to be
scientifically informative. While genetic sequences between humans are
greater than 99% identical, SNPs are the points that differ. SNP
chips, derived from blood or saliva samples, allow researchers to
acquire a large set of SNPs for an individual. Early SNP chips tracked
up to 500,000 variants across the genome; recent technology allows for
detection in excess of millions of SNPs.



With the development of fast and affordable SNP chips within the past
20 years, geneticists now have the ability to assess large populations
for DNA-based differences between individuals, which confers a new
approach to estimating heritability (Mills et al., 2020). The first
human genome sequence cost around $1 billion but now entire genomes
can be sequenced for between $200 and $2000, rendering lots of genomic
data relatively cheaply. SNP chips standardly contain a fraction of
each genome and are now very cheap to produce. Through a large family
of approaches, genome wide association studies (GWAS) identify
statistical associations between SNPs and thousands of phenotypes,
from physical traits (e.g., height, weight, BMI, etc.) to behavioral
and psychiatric traits (e.g., IQ, schizophrenia, depression, etc.)
and, more recently, to social and behavioral outcomes (e.g.,
educational attainment, household income, and math ability). Most GWAS
are conducted as case-control studies: SNP profiles are collected from
one population of individuals who share a trait (such as high ADHD or
macular degeneration) and these are compared to the SNP profiles of a
control population lacking in the trait under investigation.



GWAS identify SNPs that are statistically correlated with phenotypes
of interest. After nearly a century of twin and family studies
consistently demonstrating relatively high heritability of traits,
there was some expectation within the behavioral genetics community
that early GWAS would find similarly large SNP-heritabilities. GWAS
results in this respect have been disappointing. For example, while
twin studies indicate that roughly 50% of the total variance in
cognitive ability is explained by genetic differences, individual SNPs
associated with cognitive ability typically explain less than .04%
total variance.


4. Polygenic Scores and SNP-heritability



Given the disappointing proportions of variance accounted for by
individual SNP hits identified by GWAS, behavior geneticists and
researchers in socio-genomics have developed polygenic risk scores
(PRS) or, more recently, polygenic scores (PGS) (The term polygenic
index (PGI) is also used by some researchers for the same measure.).
In the simplest form, a PGS represents a sum of the many, miniscule
effects of all SNPs significantly associated with a phenotype of
interest (See Mills et al., 2020, 105). With N referring to the number
of statistically significant SNPs, and 
β
i
 as the
beta (or effect size) of each individual variant (
i
) for an
individual sample of DNA (
j
), a basic polygenic score is
calculated using the following formula:




P
G
S
j
=
∑
N
i
β
i





In an effort to increase the amount of phenotypic variance accounted
for by GWAS results, Yang et al. (2015) developed genome complex trait
analysis (GCTA), now referred to as ‘SNP-based
heritability’ or ‘SNP-heritability’ presented as
h
2
SNP
 (Mills et al. 2020). SNP-heritability
typically refers to the proportion of phenotypic variance accounted
for by available SNPs (Mills et al. 2020). While traditional
heritability is estimated from coarse-grained genetic similarity of
related individuals, SNP-heritability is estimated from fine-grained
genetic similarity of unrelated individuals. SNP-heritability is
assessed by using a family of highly sophisticated statistical
techniques that seek to maximize proportions of phenotypic variance
attributable to observed or imputed SNP variants (See Mills et al.
2020 for an introduction to some of these techniques).



SNP-heritability exhibits a few features worth attention. First,
instead of limiting analysis to SNPs that meet the strict p-value GWAS
significance threshold, SNP-heritability is derived by analyzing the
complete set of SNPs for each participant sample, even those that are
not associated with the trait of interest. To this end,
SNP-heritability is biologically non-obvious. Second, SNP-heritability
assumes linear additivity of SNP effects. Third, SNP-heritability
represents the current limit on the total variance that could be
explained by SNPs, for any given phenotype. So, for example, if a
polygenic score were maximally predictive, it would be equivalent to
SNP-heritability. Fourth, SNP-heritability is consistently lower than
twin heritability, for any behavioral trait. This gap between twin
heritability and SNP-heritability is sometimes referred to as the
missing heritability problem, which we discuss below.


5. Philosophical issues arising from twin studies and heritability analysis



Discussions of the viability of heritability measures were very heated
in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s discussions about IQ and race
came to a head (this issue was revisited in the 1990s with the
publication of Herrnstein and Murray (1994)), and in the late 1970s
and early 1980s sociobiology came under critical scrutiny. Both
proponents of the hereditary nature of IQ and sociobiologists made a
connection between human behavioral traits and genes. Hereditarians in
the IQ debates explicitly relied upon twin heritability analyses such
as those introduced above. Critics of sociobiology and hereditarianism
over IQ included biologists, philosophers and many social scientists
as well as many left-leaning political and social activists (See Gould
(1981), Paul (1998) and Segerstråle (2000) for some of the
relevant history here).



The point of departure for many philosophers criticizing heritability
analysis is Lewontin’s (1974) paper on the analysis of variance.
(It is worth noting that Lewontin’s paper is somewhat informal
and should perhaps be best viewed as Lewontin’s attempt to pass
on the received wisdom among population geneticists at the time to a
wider audience. The formal arguments Lewontin alludes to are presented
in a number of places including Layzer (1974) (and later Kempthorne
(1978)) and precursors to these arguments can be found in Hogben
(1933) and can also be found in R.A. Fisher’s work (See also
Sarkar 1998).) Lewontin claims that equation 
(

above presents the most accurate picture of the contributions to
phenotypic variance. He goes on to argue that

 are not negligible (a point Falconer had already
made in 1960, as noted above). In fact, Lewontin argues that these are
always part and parcel of the variance in traits. As a result,
apportioning the phenotypic variance between genes and environment is
no easy matter and standard analyses of variance simply cannot come up
with useful and informative values for 
h
2
b
 and 
h
2
. Lewontin
also points out that many proponents of heritability measures
mistakenly attribute the heritability values to individuals rather
than populations. Further, he argues that norms of reaction gave a
more accurate picture of the relations between genes, environment and
phenotypic traits. A norm of reaction is a graph of a quantitative
phenotype plotted as a function of environment for different genotypes
(See Figure 4. below, from Lewontin 1974). Many philosophers and
biologists have extended and refined Lewontin’s criticism of the
analysis of variance (e.g. Block 1995, Kitcher 1985, Sarkar 1998,
Sober 1988, Northcott 2006) and most share his conclusions that
heritability measures are hard to come by and that norms of reaction
are a superior way to examine gene/environment interactions.








Figure 4.





Lewontin (2006) later adds “The point of the (1974) paper was to
explain why the statistical partitioning of observed variation in
phenotype into variance associated with variation in genetic
relationship as opposed to variance assigned to environmental
dissimilarities does not, in fact, separate genetic and environmental
causes in development” (2006, 536). He adds that advances in
molecular genetics now make it “possible to provide a detailed
molecular analysis of the chain of causation between nucleotide
substitution and cell development and function” (Lewontin, 2006,
536). (Sober (1988) also emphasizes this aspect of Lewontin’s
criticism of the analysis of variance.) Lewontin makes clear what he
takes genetic causation to be: the causal chain from a DNA sequence to
a protein product taking place within cells of organisms. His point is
that statistical methods of population genetics and behavioral
genetics alone are not appropriate to the task of revealing genetic
causes construed this way. We revisit this issue in Section 6. recast
in light of GWAS and other “molecular” techniques of
measuring heritability.



One response to these kinds of criticisms is to emphasize caution in
the use of heritability measures and to re-emphasize Lewontin’s
point that such measures do not provide information about the traits
of individuals (See e.g. Plomin et al. 1990; 1997, Hamer and Copeland
1998). Kitcher (1985) pointed out in response to this line of defense
that words of caution do not seem to be enough and many behavioral
geneticists and psychologists still talk as if they can discover the
genetic components of human behavioral traits by using heritability
analyses. A second line of response is to argue that norms of reaction
are almost impossible to generate for complex human traits and, as a
result, are not a serious contender in the business of ascertaining
the genetic causes of human traits. Lewontin himself introduced this
problem for norms of reaction. In organisms whose genotypes and
environments can be exhaustively manipulated, a norm of reaction for a
particular trait can be produced. Lewontin cites early work on

Drosophila
 larvae’s responses to temperature as
pioneering work of this kind. The problem for most human traits,
particularly human behavioral traits, is that we have no clear sense
of either what the relevant genes to examine are or what the range of
relevant environments is. This response need not necessarily blunt
Lewontin’s critical attack on heritability measures, as in cases
where a norm of reaction can be reliably produced, we do have more
information about the relations between genes and environment than can
be provided by a standard analysis of variance. Further, attempts to
experimentally partition the contribution of genetic variance to
phenotypic variance run into problems for human traits similar to the
problems presented by attempts to generate norms of reaction. The
examples in Section 2. above are artificial for a reason: it is hard
to establish the relevant genotypes and environments that lead to
variance in human traits. The current consensus among philosophers of
biology is that heritability analyses are misleading about the genetic
causes of human traits but Pearson (2007) provides a cautious defense
of the explanatory usefulness of heritability analyses. Omri Tal also
presents modest defenses of heritability via his application of
probability to heritability analysis. He does this both in cases in
which there is assumed to be no gene-environment interaction (2009)
and in cases in which there is gene-environment interaction (2011).
Sesardic’s (1993 and 2005) work stands in stark contrast both
the anti-heritability consensus and the moderate and carefully
measured support for heritability provided by Pearson and Tal.
Sesardic strongly supports heritability analyses and vehemently
criticizes critics of heritability analysis. In recent years other
philosophers have come to defend causal interpretations of
heritability, such as Lynch and Bourrat (2016). Bourrat (2019), in
particular, considers causal interpretations of heritability using an
interventionist framework of causation. Finally, work on norms of
reaction (see e.g. Pigliucci 2001) since Lewontin’s invoking of
the measure reinforces his point about the information that can be
gained from such analyses.



There is something of a consensus in many fields (e.g. philosophy of
biology, evolutionary biology and population genetics) that
heritability measures only have a very limited use (Downes and Kaplan
(2022) provide a recent expression of this view). The consensus among
philosophers of biology is that broad heritability measures are
uninformative but there are a few dissenting voices (e.g. Sesardic
1993 and 2005, Pearson 2007 and Tal 2009 and 2011). (The notion of
consensus used here is informal, techniques in science studies and
experimental philosophy of science could be used to test claims of
consensus.) Kaplan (2000) provides an introduction to heritability and
its use in behavioral genetics. Sarkar (1998) presents a sophisticated
(and technically quite difficult) treatment of arguments against
heritability. Freeman and Heron (1998) present a clear analysis of the
problems with the use of heritability measures by proponents of the
connection between IQ and race (understanding this analysis requires
some knowledge of statistics). Block (1995) presents an overview of
arguments against the use of heritability measures in the IQ and race
literature. This overview is helpful and specifically designed for a
non-technical audience. Sober (1988) presents a defense of
Lewontin’s (1974) criticism of the use of the analysis of
variance in assessing the role of genes in the formation of traits of
individuals and Northcott (2006) provides further helpful analysis of
Lewontin’s and Sober’s work. Both Tabery (2014) and Taylor
(2014) provide sustained criticism of heritability analysis via their
alternate reflections on the nature/nurture debates. Finally,
Turkheimer (2000) provides a critical perspective from within behavior
genetics on the value of heritability measures derived from twin
studies.



Sesardic’s recent work is a criticism of those who invoke
Lewontin-style arguments against heritability analyses. He argues in
favor of hereditarianism by attacking its critics. He summarizes his
complaint as follows: “For some reason in [the heritability]
debate philosophers have displayed a surprising lack of intellectual
curiosity and analytical acuity” (2005, 9). This is because
“they hastily accepted anti-hereditarian arguments that
possessed only superficial plausibility” and “are often
poorly informed about basic scientific facts in the very domain of
their explorations” (2005, 9). Sesardic’s criticism is
polemical and does not introduce any new techniques in heritability
analysis to the philosophical audience. Rather, he relies on a
recapitulation of earlier views, such as those of Jensen, one of the
original targets of Lewontin’s critique. There are several
spirited responses to Sesardic’s book (Tabery’s 2006 and
2009b reviews are examples) and Gri Oftedal (2005) presents a
clarification of the issues at stake between Sesardic and
Lewontin.



Part of what is at stake between followers of Lewontin and Sesardic is
whether or not 
V
G
x
E
 and other components of variance are
negligible or significant. This issue is not purely philosophical and
can and has been tackled experimentally. Tabery (2009a and 2014) draws
attention to a longitudinal study by psychologists Caspi and Moffitt,
who show GxE effects in a longitudinal study of human anti-social
behavior disorders, in support of a view in line with
Lewontin’s. Douglas Wahlsten also pursues this issue in much of
his experimental work (Wahlsten 1990 summarizes his theoretical views
and Wahlsten and Gottfried 1997 is a good survey of some of the
relevant experimental work on animals). Further, understanding
gene-environment covariance, 
C
O
V
(
G
,
E
)
, as part of heritability
has led some to incorrectly attribute environmental effects on
phenotype to genes. Dickens and Flynn (2001) use an example of
basketball playing ability, which they label BP, to make this point.
They argue that if we assume that BP is highly heritable, there still
appears to be a large environmental component to BP. On their account,
this makes sense is we take gene/environment covariance seriously.
Just as our tall plants, in Section 2. above, can end up in nutrient
rich environments that shorter plants do not, tall, athletic
individuals are often placed in environments that enhance their BP. As
Dickens and Flynn point out, identical twins who are tall and
athletic, including those separated at birth, could have parents who
play basketball with them or could be placed in basketball training
regimens in school or college. In these situations each
individual’s BP would increase but it is wrong to attribute this
increase in BP to genes for height and athleticism, since the relevant
environment has a significant influence on the phenotype.



There is some irony in the fact that philosophers of biology, who
focus their attention almost exclusively on evolutionary biology, are
critics of heritability. Heredity is a central component to
evolutionary change and heritability analysis, particularly via the
notion of realized heritability (see equation (5) above), is an
important component of theoretical evolutionary biology (See Lynch and
Walsh 1998). Much of the critical attack on heritability arises
against the background of nature/nurture debates (see e.g. Tabery
2014) and concerns over genetic determinism and is best understood as
a critical appraisal of behavioral genetics in psychology. There is
growing interest among philosophers in critically assessing the notion
of heritability in its evolutionary context. The notion of realized
heritability is briefly discussed by Samir Okasha (2006) (See also
Downes 2010) and by Sober (2008). Until recently, thorough discussion
of the relations between heritability and other central concepts of
evolutionary theory was pursued exclusively by evolutionary biologists
(See e.g. Lynch and Walsh 1998 and Rice 2004). Peter Visscher et
al.’s (2008) review article is a nice introduction to much of
the work in this area. Philosophers have now presented and defended
some radical claims about heritability and heredity including the
claim that evolution can occur without heredity (see e.g.
Earnshaw-Whyte 2012 and Bourrat 2013). Focusing on heritability in the
context of evolutionary theory is a productive area for philosophical
research as evidenced by Bourrat’s (2014) examination of the
role of heritability in the recipe approach to evolution by natural
selection. Finally, further expanding philosophical perspectives of
heritability in evolutionary biology, Bourrat (2022) attempts to
develop a ‘unified’ conception of heritability.


6. Philosophical issues arising from GWAS, PGS, and SNP-heritability



The lion’s share of philosophical discourse on heritability
engages what, today, may be considered the prior paradigm of genetics:
traditional twin study genetics. The development of alternative
methods of estimating heritability (e.g., GWAS and SNP-heritability)
has engendered both a return to old philosophical questions in light
of new methods, as well as identification of novel philosophical
issues arising from recent technological developments.


6.1 Revisiting Old Questions



A majority of philosophical discourse on traditional heritability can
be roughly characterized with two questions. First, is heritability
useful? Second, is heritability causal (i.e., does it elucidate causal
relationships between genotypes and phenotypes)? Although these two
questions are closely intertwined, they do capture distinct
philosophical issues related to heritability that are now being
re-examined in light of SNP-heritability. As of this SEP entry’s
update, while the field’s interest is on the rise, only a
limited number of papers have been published on this topic by
philosophers.



Notably, the development of GWAS and SNP-heritability raises anew old
philosophical questions regarding causal relationships. Researchers in
the field are well aware of a handful of conceptual issues that
provoke skepticism regarding the question of whether or not SNPs
identified by GWAS are causal or not. John Dupré identifies
GWAS as one among several approaches in the increasingly large effort
to correlate genetic differences with phenotypic differences. He says
that GWAS “uses the large amount of genetic data we now have
about human populations to find correlations with medical outcomes
— physiological and psychological disease” (2013, 285).
Dupre goes on to say “as everyone involved in such research is
aware, this is hardly a search for sufficient causes. GWAS will at
best provide clues to the detailed causal processes involved in
pathology” (2013, 286). Some GWAS researchers are more bullish
on causation than Dupré indicates (See e.g. Plomin 2018). A
well-known issue in population genetics, linkage disequilibrium,
occurs when there is non-random association of alleles at different
loci. GWAS researchers acknowledge that many of the SNPs of interest
today are in linkage with many other SNPs in the genome. The
implication is that it remains underdetermined whether SNPs are causal
variants, or merely in linkage with causal variants (perhaps through
evolutionary drift). It is also possible that the SNPs of interest are
in no way casually relevant to the trait(s) under consideration.



There is also strong evidence that current GWAS are susceptible to
population stratification. Because human populations exhibit ethnic or
cultural subgroups with distinct allele frequencies, population
stratification increases the likelihood that GWAS identify false
positive SNPs (See Schaffner 2016). Not only is there evidence of
population stratification among large groups of individuals of
different biogeographic ancestries (Europeans, Asians, Africans), but
populations are stratified within groups as well. For example,
individuals of European descent would include both Parisians as well
as English immigrants to the United States.



What may be the greatest impediment to causal interpretations of
SNP-heritability is that GWAS and associated techniques have not yet
led to many biological discoveries (See Turkheimer 2012).
SNP-heritability is constructed using all genetic variants included in
any given SNP chip, a significant portion of which are statistically
insignificant. Moreover, although SNP-heritability purports to provide
another genetic explanation of phenotypic variance, SNP-heritability
has not led to the discovery of meaningful biological accounts or
etiologies that would causally link patterns of nucleotides to
patterns of complex human behaviors (See e.g. Meyer et al. 2023).
Judea Pearl and Dana MacKenzie refer to GWAS as a “prototypical
‘big data’ method that allows researchers to comb through
the whole genome statistically, looking for genes that happen to show
up more in people with a certain disease” (2018, 339–340).
They go on to say “It is important to notice the word
‘association’ in the term GWAS. This method does not prove
causality; it only identifies genes associated with a certain disease
in the given sample” (340). They echo our point here, in saying
that the methods used in GWAS hamper efforts at making causal
inferences.



Despite limited publications, there appears to be a growing consensus
in the philosophical community that most, if not all, of the old
problems with (or criticisms of) traditional heritability measures
have not been obviated by the most recent developments in genomics
(namely, GWAS, PGS, and SNP-heritability). PGS are embraced by many
practitioners in medical genetics and behavior genetics due to their
promise of delivering about genes causing traits in individuals, as
opposed to rendering population measures. However, Sarkar (2023), for
example, argues that, like traditional heritability, PGS are
problematized by GxG and GxE interactions and, consequently, are not
useful. Relatedly, Woodward and Kendler (2023) argue that PGS are not
causal (although they can have useful applications). Serpico (2023)
argues that the idealizations built into the models that underlie PGS
undermines their effectiveness and Tabery (2023) contends that PGS
will not deliver the precise predictions required for
“personalized” medicine. Non and Cerdeña (2024),
while more sanguine about applications of PGS in medicine than Tabery,
recommend caution in the context of genetics of social and behavioral
traits. On the other hand, practicing geneticists engaging in
philosophical discourse argue that PGS are both causal and useful with
respect to all traits (See e.g. Madole and Harden 2023). Lynch (2021)
provides a useful overview of appeals to causal language in genetics.
Further, Lewontin’s (1974) critical take on the generalizability
of heritability — the problem of portability — has been
likened to a similar problem of generalizability for PGS (Matthews
2022).


6.2 The Missing Heritability Problem



The new methods used, and new kinds of evidence found, in the
scientific examination of the relationship between genotype and
phenotype have generated at least one novel philosophical problem,
referred to as the missing heritability problem. The development of
GWAS, PGS, and SNP-heritability has created a variety of different
ways of measuring the purported influence of genotypes on phenotypes,
in comparison to traditional heritability. At face value, the missing
heritability problem arises out of a numerical gap between traditional
heritability estimates and SNP-based heritability estimates of the
same trait. For example, traditional heritability estimates for IQ
obtained using twin and family studies range between .5 and .7 while
SNP-based heritability estimates of IQ are currently no greater than
.25 (Plomin and von stumm 2018). Missing heritability is greatest
among complex, behavioral traits.



Since Maher (2008) first coined the term “missing
heritability,” statisticians and geneticists have written
extensively about the issue. In nearly all cases, contributors speak
to possible explanations for why there is missing heritability and
emphasize technological and methodological solutions that should close
the numerical gap between traditional and SNP-heritability estimates
(But see Turkheimer 2011). Explanations for missing heritability
typically focus on various manners in which standard format GWAS are
unable to track genetic effects that are unavoidably part and parcel
of twin and family studies. Notably, contributors appeal to non-linear
interactions between genetic variants (‘GxG interaction’,
or epistasis). Epistatic interactions between SNPs entail that the
effect of a given SNP will be modified (enhanced or diminished, for
example) in the presence of another SNP, which violates the additivity
assumption of SNP-heritability. Similarly, gene-environment
interaction and epigenesis have been proposed as explanations for
missing heritability (Zuk et al. 2012). Specific variants or groups of
variants may have effects that are enhanced, diminished, or even muted
with different environments, again violating the additivity assumption
of SNP-heritability. Some missing heritability may be attributable to
the presence of low-frequency, high-penetrance variants, which require
massive samples to detect (Zuk et al. 2014).



Philosophers have begun to engage the missing heritability problem in
a variety of ways. First, Bourrat and Lu (2017) defend a deflationary
approach to the problem by arguing that it is largely
‘dissolved.’ in two complementary steps. On the one hand,
Bourrat and Lu indicate that the numerical gap between alternative
methods of estimating heritability may be partially narrowed by
decreasing traditional estimates, which have historically been charged
as being overestimated. On the other hand, Bourrat and Lu argue that
the numerical gap may be closed even more by altering SNP-heritability
techniques so as to include non-linear and epigenetic factors that
they claim are currently untracked by GWAS.



In contrast, Matthews and Turkheimer (2022) argue that the missing
heritability problem is much more severe and prospective dissolutions
are out of sight. Their analysis tracks the historical introduction of
missing heritability by Maher, who commented on a broader challenge
facing behavioral geneticists in the ongoing effort to explain,
understand, and accurately predict the overwhelming complex
relationships between genetic differences and complex behavioral
differences, such as schizophrenia, depression, and intelligence.
Matthews and Turkheimer offer a tripartite characterization of the
problem, which treats the numerical gap between traditional and
SNP-heritability as just one quantitative and independent leg of a
multi-faceted problem. On their view, the remaining two legs of the
problem regard prediction (the challenge of accurately predicting
complex behavioral phenotype from molecular genotype) and mechanism
(the challenge of elucidating meaningful causal-mechanical stories
that link molecular genetic differences to complex behavioral
differences). Although most behavioral geneticists, as well as Bourrat
and Liu, focus their efforts on the numerical gap between alternative
methods of estimating heritability, Matthews and Turkheimer emphasize
that resolving the statistical problem will not advance predictions
nor explanations of human behavior provided by heritability measures.
Finally, Matthews and Turkheimer (2021) explore implications of the
problem for topics in philosophy of biology, such as scientific
pluralism.


7. Looking forward



The study of heritability has a long and rich history. Many scientific
developments have led to refined techniques for estimating
heritability and each of these scientific developments has been the
focus of philosophical analysis. In recent years, empirical approaches
toward the investigation and construction of heritability estimates
have undergone great changes, especially with the introduction of
GWAS, SNP chips, and SNP-heritability. These recent developments are
beginning to see more attention from philosophers. There is need for
more philosophical analysis regarding the nature of heritability and a
fine-grained perspective of the differences between heritability
derived from twin studies and SNP-heritability. In addition to
philosophical arguments for, or against, causal interpretations of
SNPs and heritability, scientists present their own cases, often
appealing to sophisticated statistical techniques as sufficing for the
identification of causal relationships in human genetics. Philosophers
could profitably address such techniques — notably Mendelian
randomization — with an eye for how they align with broader
philosophical frameworks such as alternate accounts of causation (See
e.g. Woodward and Kendler (2023) for new work in this area.).



As we noted above (Section 6.2), the advent of SNP-heritability gives
rise to a new and interesting issue: the missing heritability problem.
Although Matthews and Turkheimer (2021) have considered the
implications of the missing heritability problem for debates about
scientific pluralism, we expect that the implications are broader.
More philosophical work here should prove to be productive.



Finally, heritability is unequivocally tethered to bioethics. To the
extent that twin heritability estimates played a central role in
debates about race science from the 70s through the 90s, the advent of
SNP-heritability warrants a renewed assessment. Just as it was for
twin heritability, SNP-heritability is now being used to assess old,
controversial questions about the genetic basis of racial differences
in intelligence and cognitive ability. As twin heritability and
SNP-heritability are conceptually and methodologically distinct, there
is demand for philosophers and scientists to re-assess the legitimacy
of group-difference investigations that appeal to
SNP-heritability.
