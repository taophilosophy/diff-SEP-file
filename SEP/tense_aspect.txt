Tense and Aspect
First published Tue Jan 7, 2014; substantive revision Fri Feb 9, 2024








Time flies like an arrow.… Fruit flies like a banana.


—Oettinger (1966)





Many languages have grammatical means to indicate the time when an
action or event occurs, or when a state or process holds. This
phenomenon is called 
tense
. In English, for example, adding
the morpheme 
-ed
 to the verb 
walk
, to form

walked
, indicates that the event denoted by the verb occurred
before the present time. What is called 
aspect
, on the other
hand, deals with the internal constituency of actions, events, states,
processes or situations. For instance, it may indicate that an action
is completed or still ongoing. English typically uses the

-ing
 form of verbs to indicate ongoing processes, as in

He is building a house
.



After a short introduction to basic notions of tense and aspect we
briefly discuss temporal logic, and then Reichenbach’s famous
distinction between speech time, event time and reference time.
Event-based semantic theories treat events as ontological primitives,
so in the following section we show how time can be constructed from
event structures, as exemplified by the Russell-Kamp construction.
These sections are followed by a discussion of the most important
observations concerning lexical and grammatical aspect, including the
famous imperfective paradox. Next we introduce two widely discussed
theories of temporality and show how they cope with the imperfective
paradox. This section is followed by one that shows how temporal
information is expressed in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We use the
event calculus from AI to present a solution of the imperfective
paradox, by viewing it as an instance of the frame problem. The
following section is devoted to gathering psycholinguistic
evidence showing that at least some of the philosophical and semantic
concepts discussed in this article may be cognitively real. The last
section discusses some aspects concerning the
interrelationsship between temporal interpretation and the
larger discourse structure.

1. Introduction




Tense
 roughly means reference to the time at which events
take place, or at which processes or states hold. English, for
example, clearly distinguishes between past and non-past tense as in
(1a) and (1b) and (1c).




1.




(a)


John promised to pay ten pounds.


(b)


I promise to pay you ten pounds.


(c)


The student will work on his thesis.





In English, 
verb
 forms are typically used to signal the time
when an action or event occurs or a state holds. Thus in (1a),
John’s promise was given before the present time, in (1b) the
promising is simultaneous with the present time and (1c) says that the
student’s work on his thesis will occur at some time after the
present. It should be noted that the verb forms used to express
temporal information may also be used to signal information that is
not purely temporal. For instance, the present tense form in 
John
walks
 characterizes a certain habit of John. And in the statement

The train departs at five o’clock tomorrow
, the present
verb form clearly has a futurate meaning. So English distinguishes
between past and non-past but not between future and non-future.
Moreover, many linguists exclude future as a pure tense, because the
auxiliary 
will
 may be used to express volition as in 
He
will go swimming in dangerous
 water
.
[

]



Apart from 
absolute
 tense—exemplified by
(1a)–(1c)—where the reference point from which the
location in time is evaluated is the present, there is also

relative
 tense where the reference point is not necessarily
the present but may be given by context. Thus in a sentence like

The student had worked on his thesis
 the student’s work
took place at a time before a reference point in the past, in contrast
to (1c) where the reference point is the present. Other instances of
relative tense in English are the present perfect and the future
perfect in (2a) respectively (2b).

(a)


I have lost my watch.


(b)


The student will have finished his thesis next month.





The notion of 
aspect
 according to Comrie refers to
“[the] different ways of viewing the internal temporal
constituency of a situation” (1976: 3). It is customary to
distinguish between 
lexical
 and 
grammatical
 aspect.
The following are examples concerning lexical aspect. Since Vendler
(1967) linguists distinguish at least four aspectual classes. These
are states like 
know
, activities like 
run
,
accomplishments like 
cross the street
 and achievements
exemplified by a verb like 
recognize
. Accomplishments
describe the internal temporal constituency of a situation in a more
detailed way than (say) activities. 
Crossing the street
, for
example, includes the starting of a crossing activity which goes on
for some time and involves a result state that is characterized by
being on the other side of the street. No such elaborate descriptions
are necessary for activities or achievements. There are grammatical
means of distinguishing between these aspectual classes. For example,
states and achievements cannot occur with the progressive while
activities and accomplishments can; more about this below in
 
Section 5
.
 These differences are customarily considered to be lexical
differences and this area is therefore dubbed 
lexical

aspect.



A further crucial aspectual difference is that between perfective and
imperfective aspect. Comrie characterizes these notions as
follows.





…perfectivity indicates the view of the situation as a single
whole, without distinction of the various separate phases that make up
that situation, while the imperfective pays essential attention to the
internal structure of the situation. (Comrie 1976: 16)





In English this difference is often expressed by 
grammatical

means, for instance by past tense versus past progressive. This is an
instance of grammatical aspect. Slavic language often have an
elaborate grammatical system to signal the difference between
imperfectivity (ipv) and perfectivity (pv). Here is an example from
Russian.

Sentence (3b) presents the writing of a letter as a single whole and
it is clear that this activity was finished when the letter was
brought to the post office. By contrast, (3a) focuses on an ongoing
activity of letter writing in the past which is not completed because
of the interruption. In fact it is consistent with the truth of (3a)
that the letter was never completely written.



The natural language categories 
tense
 and 
aspect

embody the linguistic encoding of time. From a typological point of
view these categories are typical verbal
 categories.
[
2
]

 This means that if these categories are morphologically realized in a
language then these morphemes attach to the verb. Verbs usually
express events, processes, actions or
 states
[
3
]

 and the temporal morphemes locate these eventualities in time. Of
course this does not mean that languages that lack such morphemes are
not able to express temporal relations. They just have to choose other
means for this purpose. One famous example of a language not
containing temporal morphology is Mandarin Chinese. Often tense and
aspect cannot be clearly separated. For example the Quiché
prefix 
x
−
 denotes a completed (aspect) action in the past
 (tense).
[
4
]



Typologists also observed an asymmetry between past and future. Most
languages that possess temporal morphology use these means to
differentiate between past and non-past. There are, however, a few
languages which use temporal morphology to distinguish between future
and non-future.



We will not go into further details concerning the linguistic
realization of tense and aspect, but present a brief and necessarily
incomplete review of major philosophical and semantic theories of
these notions.


2. Temporal Logic



Temporal logic was introduced by Arthur Prior (see for instance Prior
1967). Here we will sketch only propositional temporal logic (for a
more thorough introduction the reader is advised to consult Gamut
1991: chapters 2 and 3) and the entry on
 
temporal logic.

 Temporal logic introduces operators 
G
, 
H
, 
F
 and

P
, which are similar to the modal operators 
◻
 and

⬦
. We summarize the intuitive meaning of these operators in
Table 1.




Table 1.






G

H

ϕ
 




F
ϕ


it will at some stage in the future be the case that

ϕ
 




P
ϕ


it was at some stage in the past that 
ϕ
 







By adding the above operators to propositional logic we extend
propositional logic to propositional temporal logic. Let 
q

abbreviate the sentence 
Sam is working
, then we are able to
express the following verb tenses in temporal logic:




4.




(a)
q
   Sam is working


(b)
F
q
   Sam will work.


(c)
P
q
    Sam worked.


(d)
PP
q
    Sam had worked.


(e)
 
FP
q
    Sam will have worked.


(f)
PF
q
   Sam would work.









A model 
M
 for propositional temporal logic consists of a
nonempty set 
T
 of moments of time, an earlier than relation

≺
 and a valuation function 
I
 which for each moment of time
and each proposition letter 
q
 assigns a truth value 
I
M
,
t
(
q
)
. The following definition characterizes 
I
M
,
t
(
ϕ
)

for the temporal operators.




Definition 1.
 
Let 
M
 be a model, then

I
M
,
t
(
ϕ
)
 is defined by the following clauses:




I
M
,
t
(
G
ϕ
)
=
1
 
iff for all
 
t
′
∈
T


such that
 
t
≺
t
′
:
I
M
,
t
′
(
ϕ
)
=
1
.

(

iff there exists
 
t

T


 
such that
 
t

:
I

t

.


I
M

T


 
such that
 
t
′
≺
t
:
I
M
,
t
′
(
ϕ
)
=
1
.







These clauses are analogous to the clauses which define the modal
operators 
◻
 and 
⬦
—with 
G
 and 
H

corresponding to 
◻
, and 
F
 and 
P
 to

⬦
—but instead of possible worlds the valuation
function takes moments of time as arguments. Therefore principle (5)
is valid in any model, since the modal analogue is valid for 
◻

independently of the accessibility relation.

 (and
analogously for

. 





However, principle (6), which is often considered as valid for

◻
, is presumably not valid for 
G
.




6.


 
G

Formula (6) is equivalent to 
ϕ
→
F
ϕ
. The latter
formula says that if 
ϕ
 is the case then 
ϕ
 will be the
case, which is intuitively incorrect. Suppose that 
≺
 is
irreflexive; this assumption makes sense since it means that no time
point is earlier than itself. But under this assumption, Principle (6)
is obviously wrong. For extensions of temporal logic and more examples
concerning the correspondence between properties of models and the
validity or invalidity of formulas see Gamut 1991: chapter 2.



This concludes our brief remarks about temporal logic. We now turn to
an alternative approach due to the philosopher Hans Reichenbach.


3. Speech Time, Event Time and Reference Time



The notions 
speech time
, 
event time
, and

reference time
 were introduced by Reichenbach (1947) in order
to distinguish simple past and present perfect or, more generally,
absolute and relative tense. According to Comrie (1985), who refined
Reichenbach’s system (in Chapter 6 of his book on tense) speech
time and event time are sufficient for the analysis of 
absolute
time
; i.e., present, (simple) past and future. But for

relative tense
—of which the present perfect is but one
example—reference time is required. Let us explain these notions
by applying them to distinguish between past and present perfect.



Consider the following examples from Steedman (1997).




7.




(a) 


I have lost my watch.


(b)


 Yesterday, I lost my watch. 







It has often been observed that the present perfect in English has
present relevance. For instance the continuation of (7a) with 
but
I have found it again
 is infelicitous in English; the German
translation of this sequence is acceptable, showing that the German
perfect is more like a past tense (but see Kamp et al. 2015 for an
extensive discussion, in Other Internet Resources). The same
continuation is fine for sentence (7b). In this sense the perfect is a
relative tense and the past an absolute tense in English. Let 
E
 be
short for event time and let 
S
,
R
 stand for speech time and
reference time respectively.








Simple Past


Present Perfect
 




I saw John


I have seen John
 














 
 





For the simple past, both event time and reference time are situated
on the time line before speech time. In case of the perfect, R and S
are simultaneous and E is earlier than both R and S. Intuitively,
reference time represents the perspective from which an eventuality is
perceived on the time line. This is not a purely semantic theory of
tense like temporal logic, rather it is a pragmatic theory of tense.
In particular, reference time (in contrast to event time) has to be
mutually known by communication partners. When using the present
perfect, reference time is known since it coincides with speech time.
However, reference time is not necessarily known when the past tense
is used, since it is just required to be earlier than speech time and
to coincide with event time. This may explain why sentences in the
past sound strange when uttered out of the blue. Steedman (1997)
presents the following examples:




8.


 
(a) 
*Chapman breathed a sigh of relief.


(b)
 
 When Nixon was elected, Chapman breathed a sigh of relief.>







The past-tensed sentence (8a) uttered out of the blue is infelicitous,
while sentence (8b) is fine, since in this case the

when
-clause introduces the reference time.



This is by no means the complete story of the perfect. For example,
Comrie (1976) distinguishes four typical uses of the perfect: the
perfect of result, the experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent
situation and the perfect of recent past. For an extensive recent
discussion the reader is advised to consult Kamp et al. 2015 (in Other
Internet Resources).



The following table summarizes the positions of event time, reference
time and speech time for other tenses:




Table 2.






E, R, S


Sam is working.
 




S — E, R


Sam will work.
 




E, R — S


Sam worked.
 




E — R — S


Sam had worked.
 




S — E — R


Sam will have worked.
 




R — E — S


Sam would work.
 
 





Comrie (1985) and Gamut (1991) point out that this cannot be a
complete account for temporal constructions that occur in natural
languages. For instance the temporal profile of the sentence 
Sam
would have worked
 cannot be analyzed by using a single reference
time. This is one reason for the extended requirements for a formal
theory of tense proposed by Comrie (1985: chapter 6). Furthermore,
Blackburn and Jørgensen (2016) combine the key insights of
Prior and Reichenbach in the framework of hybrid tense logic
suggesting that the two approaches are fully compatible with each
other.


4. From Events to Time



In event semantics following Davidson (1967) events are commonly taken
as ontological primitives. This raises the philosophical question how
events and times relate to each other. A construction, due to Russell,
Wiener and Kamp, shows that the time line can be constructed from
events. We will briefly sketch this construction before we move on to
lexical and grammatical aspect.



Russell remarked:





Even if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory of
motion presupposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations
which are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the
objects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not
strictly instantaneous. Instants, therefore, are not among the data of
experience and must be either inferred or constructed. It is difficult
to see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are left with the
alternative that they must be constructed. (Russell 1914: lecture
IV)





Kamp (1979) took up Russell’s ideas and slightly modified them.
The construction takes event structures as primitives from which the
structure of time, i.e., a total order, can be derived.



An event structure 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩
 simply consists of a set
of events 
E
 and the relations 
P
 (
precedes
) and 
O

(
overlaps
) and is characterized by axioms A1–7.

)





Given an event structure satisfying these axioms, the set of instants
and their strict linear ordering can be constructed according to
definition 2. The idea is to identify an instant with the maximal set
of pairwise overlapping events. Instants are thus conceived of as
abstractions over events that happen (or go on) simultaneously. Events
linked by the precedence relation will give rise to distinct
instants.




Definition 2.
 
Let 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩
 be a
structure which satisfies axioms A1–7.




An instant of 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩
 is a maximal subset of
pairwise overlapping events, i.e., 
i
 is an instant of 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩
iff




i
⊆
E


For any 
a
,
b
∈
i
:
O
(
a
,
b
)


if 
e
∈
E
 but 
e
∉
i
 then there is 
d
∈
i
 such
that 
¬
O
(
d
,
e
)


 


Let 
I
 be the set of instants of 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩


For 
i
1
,
i
2
∈
I
 put 
i
1
<
i
2
 iff there are 
e
1
∈
i
1
 and 
e
2
∈
i
2
 such that 
P
(
e
1
,
e
2
)







We will first illustrate the Russell-Kamp construction by way of an
example and then show that 
⟨
I
,
<
⟩
 has the
properties specified in Theorem 1: it is a strict linear ordering
which gives rise to an interval structure.




Example 1.
 
Let 
E
=
{
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
}
 and

P
 be the set of ordered pairs 
{
(
a
,
c
)
,
(
a
,
d
)
,
(
a
,
e
)
,
(
b
,
e
)
,
(
c
,
e
)
}
. Given A7, the relation 
O
 consists of the set of pairs

{
(
a
,
b
)
,
(
b
,
c
)
,
(
b
,
d
)
,
(
c
,
d
)
,
(
d
,
e
)
}
. 
E
 contains three
maximal subsets of pairwise overlapping events, that is, instants

i
1
=
{
a
,
b
}
, 
i
2
=
{
b
,
c
,
d
}
 and 
i
3
=
{
d
,
e
}
.
Furthermore, 
i
1
, 
i
2
 and 
i
3
 are linearly ordered as

i
1
<
i
2
<
i
3
 because 
a
∈
i
1
, 
c
∈
i
2
 and

P
(
a
,
c
)
 hence 
i
1
<
i
2
, and 
c
∈
i
2
, 
e
∈
i
3

and 
P
(
c
,
e
)
 hence 
i
2
<
i
3
, and similarly for 
i
1
<
i
3
.



A proof of the following theorem can be found in (Kamp 1979: 379).




Theorem 1.
 
If an event structure 
⟨
E
,
P
,
O
⟩
)
 satisfies A1–7, then the structure 
⟨
I
,
<
⟩
 constructed according to definition 2 is a strict
linear ordering, i.e., the following three conditions hold:


1.
 
∀
i
1
,
i
2
(
i
1
<
i
2
→
¬
i
2
<
i
1
)
(asymmetry)
2.
 
∀
i
1
,
i
2
,
i
3
(
i
1
<
i
2
∧
i
2
<
i
3
→
i
1
<
i
3
)
(transitivity)
3.
 
∀
i
1
,
i
2
(
i
1
≠
i
2
→
i
1
<
i
2
∨
i
2
<
i
1
)
(totality)





Once having constructed the set 
I
 it is possible to define time
intervals and these, in turn, can be used to measure the temporal
extent of an event. In Example 1, for example, 
a
 
goes on

in the interval [
i
1
]
,
b
 in [
i
1
,
i
2
]
,
c
 in [
i
2
]
,
d
 in
[
i
2
,
i
3
] and 
e
 in [
i
3
]. Corollary 1 guarantees that
these intervals can be constructed (Kamp 1979: 379).






Corollary 1.
 
For each 
e
∈
E
, the set 
e
′
=
{
i
∈
I
∣
e
∈
i
}
 is a non-empty interval of 
⟨
I
,
<
⟩
.





Proof: If 
i
1
,
i
2
∈
e
′
 and 
i
1
<
i
<
i
2
, it has to be
shown that 
e
∈
i
, too. Suppose it is not. Then there is 
d
∈
i
 such that 
¬
O
(
d
,
e
)
, hence 
P
(
d
,
e
)
 or 
P
(
e
,
d
)
. In
the first case 
i
<
i
1
 and in the second case 
i
2
<
i
.
Both yield a contradiction.

We cannot give further details here, but refer the interested reader
to Thomason (1986) who discusses how to construct time as a
continuum—isomorphic to the real numbers—and uses a
different construction originally proposed by Walker (1947). Empirical
evidence for events being ontological primitives will be presented in
 
section 8

 where we review psychological studies on event perception. We will
now move to lexical and grammatical aspect, that is the expression of
event types and how a given event is conceptualized, which form basic
concepts in linguistic theory.


5. Lexical and Grammatical Aspect



Linguists distinguish four or five lexical aspectual classes or

Aktionsarten.
 The following four were introduced by the
philosopher Zeno Vendler (1967: chapter four) on the basis of earlier
work by philosophers such as Kenny, Ryle and Aristotle (see also the
entry on
 
events
).
 For a formal definition of 
Aktionsart
 the reader is referred
to van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005: 85 ff).

In addition, linguists often assume that verbs like 
flash
,

spot
 and 
blink
 form an extra class—the class
of semelfactives or points (see Smith 1991).



A useful notion for distinguishing 
Aktionarten
 is the

event nucleus
 introduced by Moens and Steedman (1988). The
event nucleus is constructed from a preparatory phase, a culminating
event and a consequent phase. Activities only refer to the preparatory
phase, states only to the consequent phase, achievements to the
culminating event and to the consequent phase and finally
accomplishments to all three parts of the event nucleus.









Vendler proposed several linguistic tests for distinguishing these
verb classes. We will present only the most important ones here; for a
much more comprehensive list the reader is referred to Dowty (1979:
60). The first test separates non-statives from statives. Only
non-statives occur in the progressive.

(a) 


*Sam is knowing the answer.


(b)

(c) 
 Sam is writing a letter.







Accomplishment verbs prefer 
i
n
-adverbials as temporal modifiers,
whereas activity verbs allow only 
for
-adverbials.

(a) 


?Sam wrote a letter for an hour.


(b)


 Sam wrote a letter in an hour.

Achievement verbs are usually infelicitous with

for
-adverbials but allow the combination with

i
n
-adverbials.




11.




(a) 


Sam reached the summit in five hours.


(b)


 Sam reached the summit for five hours. 







The last test we mention here concerns the different entailment
patterns of activities and accomplishments in the progressive.
Activities in the past progressive entail their past reading but
accomplishments in the past progressive don’t.

Sam was pushing a cart 
⇒


(b)

13.




(a)

⇏


(b)


 Sam built a house. 







This is an instance of the famous imperfective paradox. Of course,
taken literally this is not a paradox. Nevertheless the entailment
patterns (12) and (13) pose a significant problem for any formal
theory of tense and aspect. For instance, the first formal proposal
for truth conditions of sentences in the past progressive stated that
a sentence S in the past progressive is true if and only if there
exists an open interval before the speech time at which the sentence
without the progressive is true. According to definition 1.4 this
immediately validates pattern (12) but without qualifications this
truth definition does not account for pattern (13). Sections
 
6

 and
 
7

 contain extensive discussion of the imperfective paradox.



Vendler thought of the 
Aktionarten
 as lexical properties of
verbs. That this position is dubious was pointed out by many
linguists, in particular by Dowty (1979) and Verkuyl (1993). For a
simple case, consider the verb 
drink
. If we assume that being
an activity is a lexical property of this verb, then surely by
combining it with the noun 
wine
 this property is preserved
for the complex phrase 
drink wine
. However, if we combine the
verb 
drink
 with the noun phrase 
a bottle of wine
 we
turn an activity into an accomplishment. The converse problem arises
if we assume that being an accomplishment is a lexical property of

drink
. This phenomenon of aspectual reinterpretation was
dubbed 
coercion
 in Moens and Steedman (1988). In
 
Section 6.1

 we will sketch a systematic solution for these types of coercion in
mereological semantics (Krifka 1989, 1992).




Aktionsart
 is not even definitely fixed at the VP-level. The
verb 
arrive

14.




(a) 


Chapman arrived.


(b)


*Chapman arrived all night. 







is an achievement, as demonstrated by the ungrammaticality of (14-b).
But if we choose a bare plural as subject it is turned into an
activity and sentence (15) is grammatical.




15.
 Visitors arrived
all night. 



Therefore a final decision about aspectual class cannot be reached
below the sentence level. Steedman’s famous sentence (16)




16.
 It took me two
years to play the “Minute Waltz” in less than sixty
seconds for one hour without stopping. 





shows that coercion can be iterated and that aspectual class can
switch back and forth in this iteration process. We close this section
with two further examples of aspectual coercion. In the first one a
stative verb is transformed into an activity.



The verb 
resemble
 is a stative verb and therefore (17a) is
unacceptable but (17b) is fine.




17.




(a) 


*She is resembling her mother.


(b)


 She resembles her mother. 







However, if we add 
more and more every day
 to (17a) thus
forming




18.
 She is resembling
her mother more and more every day.





we get an acceptable result. This is due to the phrase 
more and
more every day
 which coerces a state into an activity. Our last
example is about temporal modification with 
for
-adverbials.
As pointed out above accomplishments are usually rather bad with

for
-adverbials. They require 
in
-adverbials. But consider
sentence (19) from van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).




19.
 
 Pollini played
Opus 111 for two weeks.





This sentence seems to be fine. However it is not interpreted as an
accomplishment any more but is reinterpreted as an iterated activity.
To get this reading, a lot of non-linguistic knowledge is required.
First, one has to guess that Opus 111 refers to Beethoven’s last
piano sonata and moreover one has to be aware that this piece lasts
about 25 minutes. Under these assumptions, sentence (19) says that
Pollini played Opus 111 repeatedly within a time span of two weeks.
Formal accounts of coercion phenomena are contained in Egg (2005), van
Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) and Steedman (1997) among others. The reader
is also advised to consult Steedman’s updated manuscript,

The Productions of Time
 (see the Other Internet Resources).
Processing studies of coercion are reviewed in Bott (2010); see also
 
Section 8.




6. Intensionality versus Events



The most influential approach to solving the imperfective paradox is
due to Dowty (1979). The basic idea is to treat the progressive as a
modal operator 
(\Box)
 but restrict its domain to inertia worlds.
The notion of an 
inertia world
 is characterized informally.
An inertia world is exactly like the real world up to the time of
evaluation; after this it may differ from the real world but is
assumed to be as similar to the real world as possible. Given this
notion, the following definition introduces truth conditions for
sentences in the progressive.






Definition 3.
 PROG
(\phi)
 
is true with respect
to interval 
I
 and world 
w
 if and only if 
\forall w' \in
IE(w)
 there exists an interval 
I' \supseteq I
 such that 
\phi

is true with respect to 
I'
 and 
w'
. In addition 
I
 should
not be the final subinterval of 
I'
. 
IE(w)
 is the set of
inertia worlds for 
w
.





Definition 3 does not yet account for the different entailment
patterns of activities and accomplishments. Two additional assumptions
are required. The first concerns activities; the second,
accomplishments.




20.
 If 
\phi
 is an
activity that is true with respect to interval 
I
, then 
\phi
 is
true with respect to any sufficiently large subinterval of 
I
.






Accomplishments like 
Mary draw a circle
 are split up into two
parts, an activity part 
Mary draw
 that satisfies principle
(20) and a result part which is characterized by the existence of a
circle. Both parts are connected by a causality relation

CAUSE
.




21.


CAUSE
[Mary draw, A circle comes into existence]





Thus an accomplishment has a richer internal structure than an
activity.



With these additional requirements, the inference patterns for
activities and accomplishments follow. Let us first show that 
Mary
was pushing a cart
 implies 
Mary pushed a cart
. Assume
that the first sentence is true in 
w
 with respect to speech time

S
. Then 
Mary be pushing a cart
 is true in 
w
 with
respect to an interval 
I
 before 
S
. According to Definition 3,

Mary push a cart
 is then true in every inertia world 
w' \in
IE(w)
 with respect to an interval 
I' \supseteq I
. Because of
postulate (20), 
Mary push a cart
 is true in every 
w' \in
IE(w)
 with respect to interval 
I \ (I
 is a subinterval of

I')
. Now, the definition of inertia worlds implies that 
Mary
push a cart
 is true in 
w
 with respect to interval 
I
. This
means that 
Mary pushed a cart
 is true in 
w
 with respect
to speech time 
S
.



A completely analogous argument shows that 
Mary was drawing a
circle
 implies 
Mary drew
. But postulate (20) only holds
for the first part of accomplishments; the result part is only
required to hold in every inertia world 
w'
 with respect to a
larger interval 
I'
, normally one after speech time. Since the
inertia worlds after 
S
 may differ from 
w
 and since the
subinterval property (20) is not required to hold for the result parts
of accomplishments, the stronger conclusion that 
Mary drew a
circle
 does not follow.



Many researchers assume that inertia worlds introduce a notion of

normality
 for the semantic analysis of the progressive. The
thunderbolt in example (22) from Landman (1992) seems to break the
normal development of the real world. Dowty’s analysis seems to
be tailored for cases like this one.




22.
 
 Mary was crossing
the street, when a thunderbolt from heaven struck her down.






However, objections have been raised to the normality interpretation
of inertia. The first one is attributed to Frank Vlach in Ogihara
(1990). Consider sentence (23)




23.
 
 John was crossing
the street, when he was hit by a truck. 





and a situation in which the truck is only a few centimeters away from
John. Moreover the truck’s speed is such that it is impossible
for it to stop before hitting John. In this situation, the normal
course of events is such that John will never reach the other side of
the street. Therefore, given definition 3, sentence (23) should be
false under these circumstances. This is intuitively incorrect. A
similar objection was raised by Bonomi (1997).



On the other hand, the normality interpretation seems to be at least
questionable. Consider the following example from Naumann and
Piñón (1997).




24.
 
 Rebecca was
running across the minefield. 





This does presumably not mean that when you are running across a
minefield, you normally will eventually get to the other side.



Note that these objections all make use of a particular informal
interpretation of the notion 
inertia
. Judging the validity of
these objections to Dowty’s theory in a precise way therefore
requires an explicit theory of this notion with exact empirical
predictions.



Dowty analyzes the progressive as an intensional construction. Does
the progressive satisfy the standard philosophical tests for
intensional constructions, that is, the invalidity of substitution of
co-designative proper names and the impossibility of pulling the
existential quantifier out of the context created by the intensional
construction (see Bealer and Mönnich (1989) for a more detailed
discussion)? Let us consider accomplishments, for example sentence
(25).




25.
 
 Jackson Pollock
was painting Ruth Rendel. 





Given that Ruth Rendel and Barbara Vine are co-designative proper
names, sentence (25) implies that 
Jackson Pollock was painting
Barbara Vine
. Therefore the first test fails. Co-designative
proper names are substitutable 
salva veritate
 in progressive
constructions. The second one, however, applies, since




26.
 
 Carlos was
building a house. 





does not imply that there is a house that Carlos was building. These
tests therefore don’t provide a clear answer to the question
whether the progressive is an intensional construction. Even if the
answer is yes, the progressive is certainly a different type of
intensional construction than, for example, propositional attitudes
like 
believe
 or 
doubt
.



An extensional alternative was developed by Parsons (1989, 1990).
Parsons, like Davidson (1967), assumes that first-order quantification
over events is possible. But unlike Davidson, Parsons assumes
quantification over eventualities in the sense of Bach (1986), which
includes events proper but also states, processes and so on. Like
Dowty, Parsons supposes that eventualities are split up into a
development phase and a culmination phase. In order to represent this
difference in first-order logic two new predicates are introduced,

Cul
(e, t)
 and 
Hold
(e, t)
. The intuitive
meaning of the first is that eventuality 
e
 culminates at time

t
. The second one says that 
e
 is either an eventuality in its
development phase or that 
e
 is a state. Given these assumptions a
sentence like 
Mary drew a circle
 is translated into
first-order formula (27), 
S
 is again short for speech time.




27.
 
 
\exists
x(Circle(x)\,\wedge
 
\exists e\exists I[I \lt S \wedge Drawing(e)\
\wedge
 
Subject(e, Mary)\ \wedge
 
Object(e, x)\ \wedge


Cul(e, I)])
 





The semantic effect of the progressive consists in transforming events
into states.



If ‘
A
’ is an event verb, then ‘be

A
-ing’ is to be treated semantically as a state verb;
otherwise, ‘be 
A
-ing’ is to be treated the same as
‘
A
’. (Parsons 1989: 222)



With this assumption the logical representation of 
Mary was
drawing a circle
 is (28).




28.
 
 
\exists
x(Circle(x)\,\wedge
 
\exists e\exists I[I \lt S \wedge Drawing(e)\
\wedge
 
Subject(e, Mary)\ \wedge
 
Object(e, x)\ \wedge


Hold(e, I)])
 





Obviously (27) does not follow from (28). But (28) does imply that
there is a circle Mary was drawing. Of course this circle may not be
complete. This means that Parson’s ontology is bound to include
incomplete objects. For a discussion of incomplete objects see for
instance Baggio and van Lambalgen (2007).



According to the quotation above, the progressive doesn’t change
anything in the case of activities. Therefore 
Mary pushed a
cart
 and 
Mary was pushing a cart
 are predicted to be
equivalent.



Parsons’ theory rests on the difference between the predicates

Cul
 and 
Hold
. This difference is left to intuition.
No axiomatisation of these predicates is given. This is one of the
objections made in Zucchi (1999). Zucchi also notes that under certain
circumstances it is possible to derive a specific version of the
imperfective paradox in Parsons’ theory. A careful discussion of
Dowty’ and Parsons’ approaches and a combination of the
two systems is contained in Landman (1992).



Another approach to the imperfective paradox and—more
generally—non-culminating accomplishments was proposed by Copley
and Harley (2015). They abandon event semantics and propose instead a
framework using situations and forces as primitives. Forces lead to
transitions between situations. Their theory is motivated by the
observation that across languages, non-culminating accomplishments are
crosslinguistically in fact a very common phenomenon (see also Martin
2019). Interestingly, these non-culminating readings are per default
conveyed by less complex expressions than complete events. Often, it
is the perfective and not the imperfective that is marked
linguistically. Prima facie, this is a problem for analyses such as
Dowty’s which assume that the imperfective paradox in accomplishments
hinges on an additional operator such as PROG. This is where Copley
and Harley’s causal analysis comes into play. Their force-theoretic
account does not run into this problem because causally efficacious
forces always take effects ceteris paribus, for instance, an effect
may not occur due to the occurrence of a counter force preventing
the effect. They develop a compositional semantic framework linking
forces to the argument structure of the sentence. At the present stage
of the theory, however, some of the basic concepts also call for
axiomatisation. For instance, it is crucial to gain a proper
understanding of what it means for a situation to be a ceteribus
paribus successor situation for some initial situation. For this
purpose, their semantic framework must be connected to a theory of
causality connecting linguistic meaning to cognition and causal
reasoning via a conceptual level integrating the two.



We will come back to the imperfective paradox in
 
Section 7

 where we combine linguistic theory with event theories from
artificial intelligence. This will give us a formalization of

ceteris paribus
 from which a new solution to the imperfective
paradox will follow.


6.1 Nominal Reference and Temporal Constitution



Let us now show that events are also useful for a systematic account
of certain types of coercion that were mentioned above in
 
Section 5
.



Intuitively there is a close link between the nominal predicates

wine
 and 
a bottle of wine
 and their verbal
counterparts (29-a), (29-b).




29.




(a) 


drink wine


(b)


 drink a bottle of wine 







Whenever there are two entities to which 
wine
 applies, this
predicate applies to their collection as well. The predicate 
a
bottle of wine
 does not have this property. Whenever there are
two different entities to which 
a bottle of wine
 applies,
this predicate does not apply to their collection. The first predicate
is 
cumulative
 (see Definition 4) the second is

quantized
 (see Definition 5). A similar argumentation applies
to the difference between the activity 
drink wine
 and the
accomplishment 
drink a bottle of wine
. It was observed by
many linguists that the combination of a verb like 
drink
 with
a cumulative predicate like 
wine
 yields an atelic predicate
like (29-a), whereas its combination with a quantized predicate yields
a telic predicate like in (29-b).



In order to account for these intuitions in a precise way Krifka
assumes that the parts of the structure 
\mathcal{M} = (\mathfrak{O},
\mathfrak{E}, \mathfrak{T})
 consisting of objects 
\mathfrak{O}
,
events 
\mathfrak{E}
 and times 
\mathfrak{T}
 are each structured
as complete join semi-lattices without a bottom element (see
Grätzer, 1978). This means that we have a two place relation

\sqcup
 (join) and relations 
\sqsubseteq
, 
\sqsubset
, and

\bigcirc
 (part, proper part and overlap) that impose part-whole
relations (mereologies, see the entry
 
mereology
)
 on the sets of objects, events and times. We cannot list all the
properties that must hold for these structures to serve as admissible
interpretations of natural language but we illustrate these properties
by giving two examples.




\forall x, y \exists z(x \sqcup y = z)
 (completeness)


\forall x, y (x \bigcirc y \leftrightarrow \exists z (z
\sqsubseteq x \wedge z \sqsubseteq y))
 (overlap)


 Given this algebraic background it is possible to state precise
definitions of cumulative and quantized predicates 
P
.






Definition 4.
 
Cumulative (CUM) reference:




\forall P (CUM(P) \leftrightarrow \forall x, y(P(x) \wedge P(y)
\rightarrow P(x \sqcup y)))
.








Definition 5.
 
Quantized (QUA) reference:




\forall P(QUA(P) \leftrightarrow \forall x, y (P(x) \wedge P(y)
\rightarrow \neg y \sqsubset x))
.





Definitions 4 and 5 now allow for a formal descripion of the
referential difference between 
wine
 and 
a bottle of
wine
.




30.




(a) 


\textit{wine}\subseteq \mathfrak{O}\wedge \textit{CUM}(\textit{wine}) 


(b)


 
\textit{a bottle of wine} \subseteq\mathfrak{O}\wedge\mathit{QUA}(\textit{a bottle of wine})
 







For verbal predicates Krifka assumes that they are event denoting and
moreover that thematic relations like 
agent
, 
theme
,
etc are represented as in (31-b). Thematic roles of verbs are crucial
since they determine which verbs give raise to the 
drink wine

versus 
drink a bottle of wine

 distinction.
[
5
]




31.




(a) 


Mary runs.


(b)


 
\textit{run}(e)\wedge\textit{Agent}(e, \textit{Mary})
 







It is now straightforward to fix the reference of the verbal
predicates in a way that exhibits their simlarity to the respective
nominal predicates.




32.




(a) 


\textit{drink wine}\subseteq \mathfrak{E}\wedge \textit{CUM}(\textit{drink wine})


(b)


\textit{drink a botle of wine}\subseteq \mathfrak{E}\wedge \textit{QUA}(\textit{drink a bottle of wine})
 







Cumulativity of nominal predicates corresponds to atelicity in the
verbal domain and a quantized nominal predicate corresponds to a telic
verbal predicate.



There is still something missing. How can the impact of the reference
of the nominal predicates on the aspectual class be derived formally?
We will present only the basic idea of Krifka’s construction here. Let

w
 be the predicate corresponding to 
wine
 and let 
e
 be
the event predicate representing 
drink wine
. The basic idea
is that an object is changed by the influence of such an event in a

gradual
 manner. Since we know that 
w
 is cumulative this
predicate also applies to proper parts of 
w
, say 
w'
. Then
given that 
drink  wine
 can be applied to 
e
 it should
also be possible to apply it to a proper part of 
e
, say 
e'
.
Quantized predicates show a different behaviour. Since 
a bottle of
wine
 is quantized no proper part of it is 
a bottle of
wine
 and therefore no proper part of 
e
 can be described as

drink a bottle of wine
. To account for this intuitive
explanation in formal terms it is necessary to specify certain
preservation properties for thematic roles since these roles relate
the algebraic structure of events and the algebraic structure of
objects. This means that notions like 
summativity
,

uniqueness of objects
 etc. have to be defined for relations
between events and objects; i.e. thematic roles.



Here we will illustrate these concepts with only one example,

summativity (SUM)
.






Definition 6.




\forall R [SUM(R) \leftrightarrow \forall e, e', x, x'[R(e, x)
\wedge R(e', x') \rightarrow R(e\sqcup e', x \sqcup x')]]





Summativity says that the sum-operation 
\sqcup
 on events and
objects is preserved under summative relations on events and objects.
For instance if we have two distinct events of 
drinking a bottle
of wine
 we get an event of 
drinking two bottles of
wine
.



With this formal background it is now possible to state exactly when a
predicate of events corresponding to a verb-phrase is cumulative,
telic etc.. Again we will just state one result. Let 
\phi = \{ e\mid
\exists x(\alpha(e) \wedge \delta(x) \wedge \theta(e, x))\}
 be such
a predicate where 
\alpha
 represents a verb—say

draw
—
\delta
 the nominal
predicate—
pictures
—and 
\theta
 a thematic
relation—say 
theme
. It then follows that one set of
conditions for 
\phi
 being cumulative is that 
\delta
 is
cumulative and 
\theta
 is summative. An example is the verb
phrase 
draw pictures
. Similar results
characterize, 
iterative
, 
telic
, 
atelic
 etc.
readings.


6.2 Compositionality



A second central linguistic problem concerns the notion of

compositionality
. It has often been claimed that event
semantics faces serious problems with compositional accounts of
quantification, negation and other logical connectives. Champollion
(2015) developed one possibility to reconcile classical
compositional semantics and event semantics. We will briefly sketch
the basic ideas of this approach here.



It has often been observed that the existential quantifier binding the
event variable always takes narrow scope with respect to other
quantifiers and operators in a given sentence. Therefore the correct
translation of




33.
 
John kissed every
girl.





in Parsonian or Neo-Davidsonian event semantics is




34.
 
\forall x(girl(x)
\rightarrow \exists e (kiss(e) \wedge Subject(e, John) \wedge
Object(e, x)))





and (35) is considered as a problematic reading.




35.
 
\exists e
(kiss(e) \wedge Subject(e, John) \wedge \forall x(girl(x) \rightarrow
Object(e, x)))


 This means that other quantifiers have to outscope the
existential event quantifier. In the example above 
every girl

has to have wide scope. This holds for examples like (36-a) and (36-b)
involving negation, too.




36.




(a)
 
No
boy laughed. 


(b)
 
John didn’t
laugh. 





In Champollion (2015) one way to achieve this goal is via type
shifting (see Hendriks 1993). We will now briefly explain the basics
of this strategy. Consider the sentence




37. 
It is
raining.





In Neo-Davidsonian approaches the semantics of the predicate

rain
 is represented as:




38.
 
[[ rain]] =
\lambda e.rain(e)





In Champollion (2015) a variable 
E
 that denotes sets of events is
introduced and 
rain
 is represented now as follows:




39.
 
[[ rain ]] = \lambda E\exists e( rain(e) \wedge E(e))





We assume here that apart from the basic types 
e
 and 
t
 there
is a type 
v
 for events. 
E
 is a variable of type 
\langle v,
t\rangle 
 and the expression in (39) is of type 
\langle\langle
v,t\rangle , t\rangle 
.



Intuitively this means that a verb will be true of a set of events
when this set contains an event that satisfies the respective verbal
denotation. Thus one may think of (39) as a type shifted version of
(38). This has consequences for the rest of the grammar. If verbs are
systematically type shifted according to (39) other grammatical
categories have to be type shifted as well in order for functional
application to work.



Let us now see how (39) allows for compositional interpretations.
Under (39) a sentence like 
It is raining
 is rendered as
(
\lambda e\ true
 is the set of all events; 
true
 could for
instance be 
x = x
):




40.
 
\lambda E\exists
e (rain(e) \wedge E(e)) (\lambda e.true)





After two application of 
\lambda
-conversion (40) reduces to




41.
 
\exists e(rain(e)
\wedge true)





which is equivalent to




42.
 
\exists
e(rain(e))





Since it is assumed that verbs introduce event variables, existential
lowest closure is enforced by applying it at the level of the verb’s
lexical entry. Sentence (33) here repeated as (43)




43.
 
John kissed every
girl.





is now interpreted as follows (neglecting tense for simplicity). We
assume the following standard representations of 
every girl

(44-b) and 
John
 (44-c). 
P
 is as usual a variable of type

\langle e,t\rangle 
 and 
j
 a constant of type 
e
.




44.




(a) 


[[\textit{kiss}]]=\lambda E\exists e(\textit{kiss}(e)\wedge E(e))


(b)


 
[[\textit{every girl}]]=\lambda P\forall x(\textit{girl}(x)\rightarrow P(x))
 


(c) 


 
[[\textit{John}]] = \lambda P.P(j)







Here we will skip the derivation of the combination of NPs with
thematic roles. In Champollion (2015) 
every girl
 as object of

kiss
 is derived from (44-b) as




45.
 
\lambda V\lambda
E\ \forall x (girl(x) \rightarrow V(\lambda e(E(e) \wedge
Object(e,x))))





where 
V
 is a variable of type 
\langle\langle v,t\rangle,
t\rangle
. Expression (45) is therefore of type

\langle\langle\langle v,t\rangle, t\rangle, \langle\langle
v,t\rangle ,t\rangle\rangle
. Functional application of this
expression with the verb 
kiss
 (of type 
\langle\langle
v,t\rangle, t\rangle
) as representated in (44-a) delivers:




46.
 
\lambda E \forall
x (girl(x) \rightarrow \exists e (kiss(e) \wedge E(e) \wedge
Object(e,x)))





(46) is the interpretation of the VP 
kissed every girl
, again
of type 
\langle\langle v,t\rangle , t\rangle 
. 
John
 as
agent is translated in a similar way as the object NP 
every
girl
.




47.
 
\lambda V\lambda
E\ V(\lambda e(E(e) \wedge Subject(e, john)))





When formula (47) of type 
\langle\langle\langle v,t\rangle ,t\rangle
, \langle\langle v,t\rangle, t\rangle\rangle
 is applied to the
representation of 
kissed every girl
 (representation (46)) the
result is:




48.
 
\lambda E \forall
x (girl(x) \rightarrow \exists e (kiss(e) \wedge E(e) \wedge
Subject(e, john) \wedge Object(e, x)))





Finally computing the closure of this formula with 
\lambda e.true

one derives (49)




49.
 
\forall x
(girl(x) \rightarrow \exists e (kiss(e) \wedge Subject(e, john) \wedge
Object(e,x)))





This shows that a tree like (50) can be interpreted in a strictly
compositional way.

Based on (40) and combining methods of the previous section with the
quantificational approach of this section, Champollion develops a
broad range of solutions for observations pertaining to scope
ambiguity in sentences like (51),

as well as to negation, conjunction and adverbial modification (see
Champollion 2015; and Coppock and Champollion 2022). These results
clearly demonstrate that there is no conflict between standard
compositional semantics and event semantics.



This concludes our glimpse of events in linguistic semantics; Readers
interested in a more comprehensive treatment of these issues may find
Champollion (2014, see
 
Other Internet Resources
)
 and Champollion (2015) useful sources. For a more philosophical
discussion of various forms of compositionality the reader is advised
to consult Pagin and Westerståhl (2010a), Pagin and
Westerståhl (2010b), Peters and Westerståhl (2006,
especially Chapter 11) and the Encyclopedia’s entry on
 
compositionality
.



We now come back to the imperfective paradox and turn to an event
calculus that was developed in artificial intelligence.


7. Event Calculus



In the following section we will show that the imperfective paradox is
an instance of the frame problem prominent in Artificial Intelligence
(AI). To this end we will explain the event calculus, which is an
extension of McCarthy’s situation calculus (McCarthy 1977)
developed by Kowalski and Sergot (1986). Then we will indicate how the
event calculus leads to a formalization of natural language tense and
aspect by analysing the imperfective paradox.



Consider narrative (52).




52.
 
 Yesterday morning
Vincent loaded the gun. Then he smoked a cigarette. After smoking he
pointed the gun at Fred and pulled the trigger. 





Assuming that shooting at somebody with a loaded gun will lead to the
death of that person, we will interpret the discourse in a way that
Fred eventually gets killed. Arriving at this inference is, however,
not a trivial task. In (33) the frame problem is exemplified in the
form of the Yale Shooting Scenario (Hanks and McDermott 1986). To
demonstrate this, we will start with a very simple calculus—a
variant of the 
Simple Event Calculus
 by Shanahan (1997) which
only incorporates a very basic notion of instantaneous change. Later
we will add axioms in order to deal with continuous change and then
return to the imperfective paradox. In short, we will argue that the
paradox can be viewed as an instance of the frame problem.


7.1 The Yale Shooting Scenario



Suppose we have three kinds of actions/events—
Load
,

Smoke
 and 
Shoot
—and three time dependent
properties, the fluents 
Alive
, 
Loaded
 and
 
Dead
.
[
6
],[
7
]

 Besides actions and fluents we will also need instants of time in our
basic ontology. The predicates listed in Table 4 are used to express
actions and their effects and to locate them in time.










Formula

Initiates
(\alpha , \beta , \tau)

Fluent 
\beta
 is terminated between times 
\tau_1
 and

\tau_2
 
 






Table 4.
 Predicates of the simple event
calculus (from Shanahan 1999)





The predicates are related to each other by a set of four simple
axioms (53)–(56). In these axioms, all variables are assumed to
be universally quantified with maximal scope. We will come to the
semantics of the implication when we have introduced the complete
scenario.




53.
 
 
Initially(f)
\rightarrow HoldsAt(f, 0)
 


54.
 
 
Initially(f)
\wedge \neg Clipped(0, f, t) \rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t)
 


55.
 
 
Happens(a, t_1)
\wedge Initiates(a, f, t_1) \wedge t_1 \lt t_2\ \wedge
 
\neg
Clipped(t_1, f, t_2) \rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t_2)
 


56.
 
 
Happens(a, t)
\wedge t_1 \lt t \lt t_2 \wedge Terminates(a, f, t) \rightarrow


Clipped(t_1, f, t_2)
 





The first three axioms state the conditions under which a fluent can
hold at a time 
t
: either it holds right from the start or it is
initiated at a time 
t_1
 before 
t
 without a terminating action
occurring in between the two. The fourth axiom defines the predicate

Clipped
(t_1, f, t_2)
 saying that a fluent 
f
 is
clipped between times 
t_1
 and 
t_2
 if it is terminated by some
action 
a
 happening between 
t_1
 and 
t_2
. Simplifying a
whole lot, the axioms (53)–(56) formalize the notion of
instantaneous change, such as two balls colliding or somebody dying.
Moreover, they embody a notion of inertia: fluents continue to hold
unless terminated.



Next, we have to translate the discourse (52) into the Simple Event
Calculus. The first set of formulas (57)–(59) states what the
mentioned actions do. These formulas provide a crude sketch of the
lexical meaning of 
load
, 
smoke
 and 
shoot
.
The effect of a 
Load
 action is to make the fluent

Loaded
 hold, a 
Shoot
 action makes 
Dead
 hold
(and 
Alive
 not hold) with 
Loaded
 being a
precondition. Finally, 
Smoke
 is assumed to have no effects
(thus, there are no rules involving 
Smoke
).




57.
 
 
Initiates(Load,
Loaded, t)
 


58.
 
 
HoldsAt(Loaded,
t) \rightarrow Initiates(Shoot, Dead, t)
 


59.
 
 
HoldsAt(Loaded,
t) \rightarrow Terminates(Shoot, Alive, t)
 





(52) comprises a 
Load
 action followed by a 
Smoke

action followed by a 
Shoot
 action. Using four arbitrarily
chosen time points 
T_1
–
T_4
 the discourse can be
represented as follows:




60.
 


Initially(Alive)
 


61.
 
 
Happens(Load,
T_1)
 


62.
 
 
Happens(Smoke,
T_2)
 


63.
 
 
Happens(Shoot,
T_3)
 


64.
 
 
T_1 \lt T_2 \lt
T_3 \lt T_4
 





From this little theory we want to derive

HoldsAt
(
Dead
, 
T_4)
. Unfortunately, this sequent
is not valid in the classical sense of being true in all models which
satisfy the theory. Think for example of a situation in which the gun
obscurely becomes unloaded while Vincent is smoking. In such a model,
the precondition of the shooting action is clearly not met and thus
the action will lack any effects. Note that nothing rules out such a
model since it is entirely consistent with our theory. We thus have to
further constrain the models under consideration. Crucially, we have
to find a way to deal with the non-effects of actions; this is the
famous 
frame problem
.



How to proceed? From the fact that no terminating action was
mentioned, we want to conclude that no terminating event occurred. To
do so, we have to strengthen the assumptions of the theory in a way
that only those events are assumed to occur which have been explicitly
stated in the discourse. The discourse model should be minimal,
linking discourse understanding intimately to 
closed world
reasoning
. It is important to note that this strategy forces
reasoning to be non-monotonic: adding further premises to a theory can
make inferences invalid that were valid before (see the entry on
 
non-monotonic logic
).


7.2 The Completion of a Program



There are different techniques for formalizing this line of reasoning;
one is circumscription (e.g., Shanahan 1997). Here, we will use the

completion of a logic program
 technique, adopting the

Event Calculus
 of van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005). Taking a
closer look at the formulas of the theory 
((53) \wedge \ldots \wedge
(64))
, an important feature to notice is that formulas come in two
variants: they are either 
facts
 consisting of a simple
predicate expression or they express 
rules
 with a conjunction
of potentially negated formulas to the left of the implication sign
and a single positive atomic expression to its right (in logic
programming the former is called the 
body
 and the latter is
called the 
head
 of a clause). We will now illustrate how the
completion of a simple logic program is computed. Consider the
description of a situation where the gun gets loaded at time 1 and a
shooting event happens at time 10. This situation is stated in the
following program:




65.
 
 
Happens(Load,
1)
 


66.
 
 
Happens(Shoot,
10)
 





The uncompleted program does not yet rule out intervening events. It
is, for example, consistent with an 
Unload
 event occurring at
time instant 9. The completion of the program should tell us that (65)
and (66) were the only events. The completion is computed according to
the following
 procedure.
[
8
]

 We start with the facts in (65) and (66). Both of these are

Happens
 formulae. The completion of the program intuitively
corresponds to an assertion that, given this program,

Happens
(e, t)
 can only mean 
Load
 occurring at 1
or 
Shoot
 occurring at 10. We therefore first substitute
variables for the constants and write the following disjunction:




67.
 
 
(e = Load \wedge
t = 1) \vee(e = Shoot \wedge t = 10)
 





Then, we universally quantify over the variables 
e
 and 
t
 and
strengthen the implication to a bi-implication:




68.


 
\forall e\forall t(Happens(e, t) \leftrightarrow (e = Load \wedge t = 1)\ \vee


(e = Shoot \wedge t = 10))
 





From (68) it follows that there were no intervening events.
Strengthening the implications to bi-implications makes it impossible
that a head can be true without the enabling conditions being
 met.
[
9
]

 The uniquely determined model of (68) is the minimal model of the
logic program consisting of (65) and (66).



We can now come back to the Yale Shooting Problem in discourse (52).
From the completion of the logic program ((53))
\wedge \ldots
\wedge
((64)) it follows (non-monotonically) that

HoldsAt
(
Dead
, 
T_4)
. Enriching the program with
further information and computing the new completion, however, could
clearly lead to cancellation of this inference.


7.3 Introducing Tense Information



If we want to use these ideas to model natural language discourse, we
need to incorporate tense. In van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) this is
done by adopting the classic tripartition into 
reference
time
, 
event time
 and 
speech time
 due to
Reichenbach (see
 
section 3
).



Recall that above, when we translated discourse (52) into
Shanahan’s Event Calculus, we arbitrarily chose instants of time

T_1 ,\ldots ,T_4
 to locate actions in time. This is not how it is
done in natural language discourse. The first sentence (
Yesterday
morning Vincent loaded the gun
) states that within some time
interval 
(=
 reference time) before now 
(=
 speech time) there
was a time 
t'
 at which a loading event happened 
(=
 event
time). The second sentence (
Then he smoked a cigarette
) is
linked to this event by the connective 
then
, stating that at
some later time 
t''
 a smoking event happened with 
t''
 also
being temporally located before 
now
. Analogously for the
third sentence: there is an event time 
t'''
 at which

Shoot
 happens and 
t'' \lt t''' \lt
 
now
. Note
that when locating events in time it is always done by existential
statements of the form 
there is a time
. So far, however, we
have only been dealing with universally quantified variables. Clearly,
a formula like 
\forall t
.
Happens
(
Load
, 
t)
\wedge t \lt
 
now
 cannot be used to represent tense since it
would state that 
Load
 happens at all times in the past. We
have to find a way to introduce existentially quantified
information.



Intuitively, it suffices to introduce new entities into the domain of
discourse. This approach lies at the heart of dynamic semantic
theories such as Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993,
and see also the entry on
 
Discourse Representation Theory
)
 or File Change Semantics (Heim 1982). We will need an update
procedure that introduces new actions/events into the discourse model
but is compatible with the non-monotonic semantics introduced so far.
Following van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) we will use 
integrity
constraints
—a device from database theory (for a more
complete and formal treatment the reader is referred to Kowalski 1995
and van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: ch. 8)—to implement the notion
of a minimal update of a discourse model. Consider discourse (69).




69.
 
 The gun is loaded.
Vincent is ready to shoot. 





In interpreting the first sentence, we want to update the situation
model in a way that makes the sentence true. The tense information
will be interpreted as a goal to minimally update the situation model
with a fluent 
Loaded
 that holds now. In our framework
semantic interpretation is thus closely linked to planning, in that
finding an interpretation for a sentences requires coming up with a
sequence of actions that makes the goal succeed.




70.
 
 Make the query

?HoldsAt(Loaded, now)
 succeed. 





To resolve this integrity constraint we will use the axioms of the
Simple Event Calculus plus the world knowledge about the consequences
of a load action stated in (71).




71.
 
 
Initiates(Load,
Loaded, t)
 





In logic programming, the sort of reasoning required to resolve (70)
is carried out by a derivation procedure called 
resolution
.
We will use resolution here in a non-standard way, i.e. logic
programming combined with integrity constraints (for details see van
Lambalgen and Hamm 2005). It starts with the formula that has to be
made true in the discourse model. Resolution proceeds by identifying
rules which have the query as their consequent and substituting the
consequent with the antecedent conditions of the rule, making the
antecedent formulas new queries themselves. The resolution stops when
the query cannot be further resolved, that is, when a plan has been
computed whose preconditions are all fulfilled given an appropriate
update of the discourse model. To get an impression of how this works
we will illustrate the resolution of (70). First, we have to compute
the completion of the program and whenever possible substitute the
variables with constants, in our case 
Loaded
 and

now
. In logic programming this substitution is done
automatically via unification. Here is the completion of the

HoldsAt
 predicate which forms the head of two
axioms—(54) and (55).




72.
 
 
HoldsAt(Loaded,
now)\,\leftrightarrow
 
(Initially(Loaded) \wedge \neg Clipped(0,
Loaded, now))\,\vee
 
(Happens(a, s) \wedge Initiates(a, Loaded, s)
\wedge s \lt now \wedge
 
\neg Clipped(s, Loaded, now))







Since the theory doesn’t contain the statement

Initially
(
Loaded
), closed world reasoning yields
that at time 0 the gun is not loaded

(\neg
Initially
(
Loaded
)). No matter how we update
the discourse representation the first disjunct can never succeed. We
thus have to move on to the second disjunct. In this case, the
database is searched for an action 
a
 and a time 
s
 such that

Initiates
(a, f, s)
, 
Happens
(a, s)
 and

\neg
Clipped
(s
, 
Loaded
, 
t)
. On the sole
basis of the information provided in the discourse the subquery
?
Happens
(a, s)
 will fail, because in discourse (50) there
is no information about a load action. However, since integrity
constraints are intended to be made true, the database will be updated
with a clause 
Happens
(
Load
, 
s) \wedge s \lt


now
 which makes the second disjunct true and the query
succeed.


7.4 The Imperfective Paradox reconsidered



In the following, we will analyze the imperfective paradox as an
instance of the frame problem (cf. Stenning and van Lambalgen 2005;
van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005; Stenning and van Lambalgen 2008; Baggio
and van Lambalgen 2007; Baggio et al. 2008). Both activities and
accomplishments involve continuous change and we therefore have to add
additional predicates and axioms to properly deal with gradually
changing objects which are under the influence of an external force.
Table 5 introduces two new predicates; axioms A1–A5 provide a
general theory of instantaneous and continuous change (from van
Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: 40). As can be easily seen, the axiom system
extends that of Shanahan (1997).

Meaning
 




Releases

Table 5.
 Predicates for continuous

\begin{align}
\tag*{A1.} & Initially(f) \rightarrow HoldsAt(f, 0) \\
 \tag*{A2.} & HoldsAt(f, r) \wedge r \lt t\ \wedge \\
 &\ \ \neg \exists s \lt r HoldsAt(f,s) \wedge \neg Clipped(r, f, t) \rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t) \\
 \tag*{A3.} & Happens(e, t) \wedge Initiates(e, f, t) \wedge t \lt t'\ \wedge \\
 &\ \ \neg Clipped(t, f, t') \rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t') \\
 \tag*{A4.} & Happens(e, t) \wedge Initiates(e, f_1, t) \wedge t \lt t'\ \wedge \\
 &\ \ t' = t + d \wedge Trajectory(f_1, t, f_2, d) \wedge \neg Clipped(t, f_1, t') \rightarrow HoldsAt(f_2, t') \\
 \tag*{A5.} & Happens(e, s) \wedge t \lt s \lt t'\ \wedge \\
 &\ \ (Terminates(e, f, s) \vee Releases(e, f, s)) \rightarrow Clipped(t, f, t') 
\end{align}





Axioms 4 and 5 define continuous change. Axiom 4 defines the

Trajectory
 predicate. To see what it says, let’s
consider a situation of 
running a mile
 where 
f_1
 is
instantiated by 
running
 and 
f_2
 by

distance
(x)
. Should 
running
 be true during the
whole interval from 
t
 until 
t'
 then 
distance
(a +
1)
 will be true at 
t'
. The value of 
x
, that is, the actual
distance actually run at each time instant will be determined by the
law of the process under consideration (here, running speed). Axiom 5
defines the predicate 
Clipped
(t, f, t')
 which is true if

f
 is terminated or released by an event 
e
 which happens in the
time interval between 
t
 and 
t'
. Thus 
Clipped
 covers
both instantaneous and continuous change. The axioms provide a general
theory of what can change and what stays constant.



For concrete situations, we also need the specific temporal and causal
relationships. This kind of information is specified in so called

scenarios
 representing lexical meaning. The lexical meaning
of the accomplishment 
run a mile
 corresponds to scenario
(73). Like the axioms, the scenario takes the form of a logic program.
All variables are universally quantified.




73.


(a)


Initially(distance(a))
 


(b)


Initiates(start, run, t)
 


(c)


Releases(start, distance(x))
 


(d)


Initiates(finish, distance(a + 1), t)
 


(e)


Terminates(finish, run, t)
 


(f)


 
HoldsAt(run,t) \wedge HoldsAt(distance(a + 1), t) \rightarrow
 
Happens(finish,
t)
 


(g)


HoldsAt(distance(x), t) \rightarrow 
 
Trajectory(run, t,
distance(x + g(d)), d)
 







Scenarios formalize the event nucleus of Moens and Steedman (1988).
Every accomplishment takes the same form of scenario, the only
differences being that the individual scenarios involve different
preparatory processes (
run
, 
build
, etc.),
incremental themes (
distance
(x)
, 
house
(x)
,
etc.) and resultant states. Furthermore, it is obvious that the
preparatory process 
run
, an activity, is a proper part of
scenario (73). The simpler activity scenario can be easily arrived at
if we remove clauses (d)–(f) from (73). We are now in the
position to solve the imperfective paradox avoiding the problems
discussed in
 
section 6
.
 Both a past progressive activity sentence as in (74-a) and a past
progressive accomplishment sentence (74-b) will trigger a discourse
update as stated in integrity constraint (74-c).




74.




(a)


John was running. 


(b)


 John was running a mile. 


(c)
 
 
?HoldsAt(run,
t) \wedge t \lt now
 succeeds. 







The discourse update of the completed program (73) yields that at some
point after 
t
 John will achieve the culmination and will have run
one mile (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: 61ff. for a proof).
Obviously, the same integrity constraint in combination with the
activity in (74-a) only licenses the inferences that there was some
past running activity. In the case of an accomplishment the course of
events dramatically changes if we add information to the
representation as in (75-b). Now, both (75-a) and (75-b) only allow
the inference that there was a running event but, arguably, John
didn’t reach his goal in (75-b). Without going into further
details it should be clear how this non-monotonic inference works. The
derivation works analogously to the simpler instances of the frame
problem discussed above.




75.




 (a)


John was running, when he was hit by a truck. 


(b)
 
 John was
running a mile, when he was hit by a truck. 







The solution to the imperfective paradox just outlined makes reference
to the intentions of the agent involved in the event; therefore the
notion of a goal or intention is built into the system right from the
start. Note, however, it does not involve possible worlds, or
primitive notions like inertia worlds; instead it is based upon
minimal models and non-monotonic reasoning. This yields additional
benefits. Firstly, the Event Calculus will compute a minimal model in
cases where an integrity constraint can be satisfied. Moreover, the
number of construction steps required for this yields a precise
complexity measure which (for example) allows us to derive predictions
for cognitive processing. Secondly, the non-monotonic nature of the
Event Calculus can be used to model the incremental construction of a
temporal model with inferences which hold locally at a discourse
segment 
s_n
 but which can be undone at some later discourse unit

s_{n+1}
. This is a necessary prerequisite if we think of
interpreting sentences like (75-b) from left to right assuming
incremental interpretation (see e.g., Baggio and van Lambalgen 2007
and Bott 2010 for implementations of the Event Calculus as a
processing model). In the next section we will review psychological
and psycholinguistic work on the interpretation of aspect which will
provide empirical motivation for the outlined analysis.


8. Cognitive Aspects



Due to limitations of space, we will not discuss psychological and
psycholinguistic studies of tense but will focus solely on processing
studies of aspect. Moreover, within this topic we limit ourselves to a
selection of studies of the adult system. The interested reader is
referred to Dickey (2001) and the references therein for
psycholinguistic work on tense as well as to the entry on
 
the experience and perception of time

 and the contributions in Grondin (2008) for psychology of time in
general.



Psychologists have extensively studied event perception and event
memory as well as their neural basis (e.g., Zacks and Tversky
2001; Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer 2001; Zacks et al. 2006; see Zacks
2020 for a review). The underlying question behind this line of
research is whether events play a role in how we cognitively structure
and remember changing states of affairs and how they are represented.
Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer (2001) use an analogy from the domain of
objects to the domain of events to define an event as a “segment
in time at a given location that is conceived by an observer to have a
beginning and an end” (p.30). They claim that “the ability
to identify the parts of events and their relationships constitutes a
distinct perceptual process” (p.30) which they call 
event
structure perception
. Just as an object is an ontological
primitive in the spatial domain, so an event is an ontological
primitive in the spatio-temporal
 domain.
[
10
]

 Objects are recognized by shape, color etc. and have boundaries in
space. Analogously, events have boundaries in time, but are also
bounded in space. An event of buttering toast, for instance, happens
at a particular time, but also in a particular location in space and
is therefore spatially bounded. Continuing the analogy, both objects
and events can be identified and categorized using hierarchical
relations.



In Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer’s experiments, participants
segmented an ongoing activity (like 
washing dishes
) while
watching it on film by pressing a key to mark “natural and
meaningful” unit boundaries. The grain at which participants
segmented the activity was manipulated between subjects: one group was
asked to mark the largest meaningful units (coarse grain size), the
other group the smallest units (fine grain size) which still could be
considered to be complete events. The placement of perceived event
boundaries provides information about the psychological status of
events and their partonomic hierarchy. If the stream of action is
perceived as consisting of discrete events, participants should place
event boundaries consistently and this is what Zacks, Tversky, and
Iyer (2001) found. Further, if participants make use of partonomic
hierarchies, coarse event boundaries should be aligned with fine
boundaries, since the end of each superordinate event is also the end
of its last subevent. Again, this hypothesis was corroborated by a
strong hierarchical bias effect. Events thus seem to be
psychologically real and to be hierarchically structured. These
effects are not limited to event perception but also affect event
memory. Furthermore, studies of event perception and event memory show
that comprehenders focus on the goal of actions rather than on their
superficial surface structures (see Zacks, 2020, and the references
therein).



While studies on event perception show that complex events are
clearly structured into simpler ones, there is also clear evidence
for 
event variability
 with great interindividual
differences in event representations (see, e.g., McRae et al.
2019). Recent advances in computational modeling show that
prediction-based neural network models can learn these rich and highly
variable event structures and produce behaviors that reflect human
performance (Elman and McRae 2019). Prediction-based neural
networks have also been successfully applied to event prediction in
text comprehension modeling effects in ERP research (Rabovsky et
al. 2018; Venhuizen et al. 2019). So far, however, to our knowledge
neither tense nor grammatical aspect have been incorporated into
these models.


8.1 Lexical Aspect



During the last decade psycholinguists have started to investigate the
cognitive reality of lexical aspect and how it is processed. The
existing studies can be sub-classified into studies concerning

Aktionsart simpliciter
 and those concerned with shifts from
one aspectual class to an other, i.e., 
aspectual coercion
. In
the following, we will provide a brief overview of both areas of
research.



McKoon and Macfarland (2002) were among the first to study processing
consequences of decompositional analyses along the lines of Dowty
(1979). They provided evidence from reading times and lexical decision
times that accomplishments 
(\alpha
 CAUSE 
x
 BECOME IN-STATE)
are inherently more complex than achievements 
(x
 BECOME IN-STATE).
Similarly, Gennari and Poeppel (2003) compared eventive predicates
(which included accomplishments, achievements and activities) to
statives and found that the former were more complex to process than
the latter. Brennan and Pylkkänen (2010) extended this line of
research to psychological verbs and compared accomplishments (e.g.,

scare
) with statives (e.g., 
cherish
) using reading
time methods and magnetoencephalography (MEG). They also included a
comparison of the simple psychological statives with modified
sentences that required coercion (e.g., 
within half an hour, the
child cherished the precious kitten
). Reading times and MEG data
indicated that accomplishments were more complex to comprehend than
statives and, moreover, that the enhanced semantic complexity led to
different MEG components than aspectual coercion. Finally, Coll-Florit
and Gennari (2011) compared durative states and punctual event
predicates (mostly achievements) and observed longer reading times of
statives than of event predicates. They attributed this
effect—which runs counter to what would be expected under a
decomposition analysis—to the fact that durative situations
occur in semantically more diverse contexts and elicit more diverse
associations than event predicates which may modulate the required
processing effort. Taken together, the existing studies provide
evidence for complexity differences between the aspectual classes,
lending support to decompositional analyses. However, not all issues
are entirely solved yet and further research is required.



The second line of research concerns aspectual coercion. Here, the
main research question has been whether aspectual coercion is a costly
operation. Existing research has almost exclusively focused on one
coercion type, i.e., coercion of point action verbs into an iterative
interpretation (but see Brennan and Pylkkänen 2010 and Bott 2010
for other types of aspectual coercion). Again, the findings are mixed.
The first studies provided evidence for coercion costs employing
secondary tasks such as 
cross-modal lexical decision
 or

stop making sense judgments
 (Piñango, Zurif, and
Jackendoff 1999; Todorova et al. 2000). Pickering et al. (2006) used
the same materials as in the experiments mentioned above, but tested a
coerced meaning during ordinary reading without an additional task. In
two self-paced reading and two eyetracking experiments, they found
aspectual coercion to be no more difficult than their aspectual
control conditions. This lack of effect let them propose the aspectual
underspecification hypothesis, stating that the aspectual
representation stays underspecified during normal reading. Brennan and
Pylkkänen (2008) challenged this view and reported a coercion
effect of coercion sentences like (76-a) as compared to aspectual
controls (76-b) both in self-paced reading and in MEG; on the basis of
a rating study they had carefully selected clear instances of point
action verbs. Their MEG study revealed activation in the anterior
midline field, a MEG component that has been observed for other
non-aspectual cases of coercion, too.

(a)


 Throughout the day, the student 
sneezed

(b)

sneezed

Complicating matters, Bott (2008, 2010) applied the same norming
procedures, but did not find evidence of coercion cost in iterative
point action verbs in German. With other types of aspectual coercion,
however, there were clear indications of processing difficulty
indicating that the underlying processes differ between coercion
types. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that at least in some
cases (achievement ⇝ accomplishment) coercion operations are not
triggered by an aspectual mismatch, but can proceed smoothly by
enriching the aspectual representation with additional eventualities.
This was shown in an event-related potentials (ERP) study in which a
double dissociation of ERP components was elicited by sentences with
aspectual coercion as compared to sentences that contained an
aspectual mismatch.



Another ERP study by Paczynski et al. (2014) investigated
the processing of iterative events due to aspectual coercion.
The critical condition involved punctual event predicates
modified by durative adverbials such as 
for several
minutes, the cat pounced on the rubber mouse
. This condition led
to a sustained negativity relative to conditions with both punctual
(
after several minutes
) and frequentive adverbials
(
several times
) similar to the ones obeserved in previous ERP
studies on aspectual coercion and the imperfective paradox (Baggio et
al. 2008, Bott 2010). One difference between Paczynski et al.’s
(2014) study and other studies on iterative coercion could be slight
but crucial differences in the semantic properties of the
punctual events: while Paczynski et al. (2014) employed telic
predicates, other studies used atelic point-action verbs.


8.2 Grammatical Aspect



Grammatical aspect has recently received increased interest in
psycholinguistics (for a comprehensive review see Madden and Ferretti
2009). One line of studies has investigated (e.g., Ferretti et al.
2007) the accessibility of event participants in English progressive
and simple sentences. They provide evidence that, in line with the
linguistic description provided above, the progressive presents an
event from the inside, making participants, instruments and places
fully accessible, whereas the simple forms present events as complete
units and the event participants are less accessible. Using picture
selection/verification, Madden and Zwaan (2003) found that
participants were faster and more likely to choose a picture showing a
complete event, rather than a picture depicting an ongoing event,
after they had read a sentence with an accomplishment verb in the
simple past. This indicates that English speakers encode
accomplishments in the simple past as complete events. This finding
was supported by a study by Anderson et al. (2008). They compared
accomplishments describing a path such as 
Tom jogged/was jogging
to the woods and then stretched when he got there
. Participants
listened to these sentences while using a computer mouse to drag and
drop a human character in a visual scene. When hearing a sentence in
the past progressive, many drops took place at the beginning and the
center of the path, whereas in the simple past most drops were at the
end of the path. Interestingly, the differences were by no means
categorical. Even in the simple past condition, the character was in
some trials positioned well before the end of the path. This indicates
that accomplishments in the simple past are consistent with incomplete
events.



Another study relevant for the discussion in the previous sections is
an ERP study on the imperfective paradox by Baggio et al. (2008). They
investigated the processing of Dutch imperfective sentences such as

het meisje was een brief aan het schrijven
 (
the girl was
writing a letter
) which were either followed by a

when
-clause that made the culmination unlikely (when her
friend spilled coffee on the paper) or by a sentence which was
compatible with the attainment of the goal (when her friend spilled
coffee on the tablecloth). The first kind of sentences elicited larger
sustained anterior negativities compared to sentences that were
compatible with the culmination. Moreover, the amplitude of the
negativity was correlated with the frequency with which participants
responded that the culmination was not reached. These findings
indicate that a progressive sentence triggers a default inference to a
complete event which can be canceled again, if the context so
requires.



Grammatical aspect is subject to clear crosslinguistic differences.
This raises the question of whether the grammatical system has an
influence on how we process language. In von Stutterheim et al. (2009)
the authors reported findings of a production study comparing event
descriptions of English, German and Dutch speakers that were elicited
while they were watching and describing a silent video clip. Their
study revealed clear differences between productions from the three
languages. English speakers used the progressive to start event
descriptions well before the endpoint was visible (e.g., 
A car is
going down a lane … to a farmhouse
). Germans showed a
different behavior, relating their descriptions to the endpoint of a
motion event. It thus seems as if production is constrained by the
language in which it is realized. Recently, von Stutterheim et al.
(2012) extended this line of research to a sample of seven languages
and showed that the aspectual properties of a language influence how
speakers conceptualize events. It’s not only that speakers of
different languages talked differently about motion events (e.g.,
mention of endpoints), their language also had a clear influence on
their viewing behavior while watching the movies and influenced their
memory capacity for those parts of the scene corresponding to
endpoints.



As for comprehension, Bott and Hamm (2014) investigated how the
aspectual system of a language influences processing difficulty. They
compared coercion of German and English accomplishments which were
modified by 
for 
x
 time
 adverbials. (77) is a sample
item.




77.




(a)
 


Der Architekt errichtete das Monument zwei Jahre
lang, aber dann wurde ihm der Kredit gekündigt.
 


(b)
 
 The architect
built the monument for two years, but then the bank canceled his
credit. 







In the German experiments, condition (77-a) was read as fast as a
non-coercing control condition with an 
in x time
 adverbial.
This was different in English where the authors found coercion to
cause a substantial slowdown of reading speed. They interpret this
crosslinguistic difference as follows: languages which have the
grammatical means to express an aspectual difference via alternative
forms—the progressive vs. simple forms in English—enforce
immediate aspectual commitment, whereas languages that lack this
grammatical feature have to leave it underspecified. In other words,
German readers will leave it to the context whether an accomplishment
expresses a complete or incomplete event, whereas English readers
immediately strengthen an accomplishment in the simple form into a
complete event interpretation. They take this strengthening to be a
pragmatic process that is due to competition between alternative
grammatical forms.



The time course of incremental aspectual interpretation has also
been crosslinguistically studied in a visual-world eyetracking study
by Minor et al. (2023) comparing English, Russian and Spanish
perfective and imperfective sentences. Participants heard these
sentences while inspecting a display showing one picture with
an ongoing accomplishment event and another one showing the
accomplishment’s consequent state. In Russian and Spanish,
comprehenders immediately started to fixate on the ongoing
event for imperfective verbs and on the completed event after
perfective verbs providing further evidence for incremental aspectual
interpretation in aspect languages. For English, however, they only
found incremental effects for progressive sentences. Sentences with
simple past forms, however, turned out to be compatible with
both ongoing and complete event interpretations. This finding
contrasts with the results reported in Bott and Hamm (2014) and
there seems to be more interpretational leeway for English
accomplishments in the simple past than previously assumed.



In an eyetracking during reading study, Bott and Gattnar (2015)
followed up on the observed cross-linguistic variation in the
processing of grammatical aspect comparing an aspect language,
Russian, with the non-aspect language German. They investigated
whether the differences in the aspectual systems of the two languages
affected the time course of mismatch detection in the case of lexical
aspectual mismatch. All test sentences contained clear instances of
(in Russian always perfective) transitive achievement verbs such as

win
, 
find
, 
reach
, 
notice
, etc.
which were modified by a semantically mismatching

for
-adverbial (e.g., 
for three hours
) or a
semantically fitting 
ago
-adverbial (e.g., 
three hours
ago
) in aspectual control conditions. Crucially, both Russian and
German have relatively free word order making it possible to test for
effects of mismatching vs. matchingadverbials in the word order

subject verb object adverbial
 but also in the order

adverbial verb subject object
. The results show that Russian
readers immediately detect the aspectual mismatch irrespective of
whether they have seen the subject or the object argument yet. This is
different in German where aspectual mismatch detection only started
after the verb plus all its obligary arguments had been encountered.
This result was modeled by Bott and Sternefeld (2017) in an
incremental event semantics drawing on insights from mereological
semantics as proposed by Krifka (1989, 1992) and building on the
compositional event semantics of Champollion (2015); see also
 
section 6.1

 (and the entry
 
mereology
).
 The incremental semantic derivations show that in a non-aspect
language like German, lexical aspect really is a property of whole
sentences and strongly depends on the compositional interpretation of
the verb, its arguments, and their thematic roles. In an aspect
language like Russian, on the other hand, the grammatical aspect
imposes itself strong constraints on lexical aspectual interpretation.
These psycholinguistic results thus nicely fit semantic proposals for
grammatical aspect that have been proposed in the framework of
mereological semantics (see, e.g., Filip 2008, a.o.). The results of
Bott and Gattnar’s study may, however, be restricted to
achievement predicates and perfective aspect since an ERP study by
Klimek-Jankowska and Błaszczak (2020) did not reveal any
effects on Polish accomplishment verbs marked for aspect. For
perfective verbs, mismatch effects were only evident on the following
object marking the incremental theme while imperfective
accomplishments were compatible with
both 
for-
 and 
in-
adverbials.
Employing self-paced reading and eyetracking during reading,
Klimek-Jankowska et al. (2018) provided further evidence for
underspecification of imperfective aspect marking in Polish. Last
but not least, Lukassek et al. (2017) investigated adverbial
modification of ambiguous German motion verb phrases such as

über die Nordsee segeln
 (
sail over the North
Sea
) with German 
in-
 and

for-
adverbials. Both types of modification turned out to be
comparable in processing
load suggesting underspecification of motion verbs with
respect to telicity. Additional evidence, however, for
the highly incremental interpretation of aspectual operators in
Russian and their relevance for language comprehension comes from a
comparison of aspect marking by means of aspect marking
via verbal suffixes vs. prefixes (Minor et al. 2022). The
comparison involved a visual-world eyetracking study employing the
same methods as in Minor et al. (2023). The study revealed a
significant difference in the onset of looks to the target with
earlier looks to the target for aspect marking with a prefix relative
to marking with a suffix. Thus, comprehenders seem in fact to
interpret aspectual operators right away as soon as they are
encountered.



To summarize, the existing studies largely lend empirical support to
the aspectual distinctions made in the semantic and philosophic
literature, even though the experimental findings provide us with a
complex picture. While some parts of  aspectual interpretation
proceed incrementally and automatically, other parts seem to call for
underspecification. Moreover, the grammatical system of a
language influences the way language is processed and may even
influence the way we experience the world.


9. Tense and Aspect meet Discourse Structure



We introduced and discussed several important semantic, philosophical
and technical concepts and theories of temporality and at least
indicated how these concepts and theories are related to cognition.
However, we did this exclusively from a sentence internal perspective.
Tense and aspect are important means for organizing discourse as well
(see Kamp, 1991). To conclude our overview, we present a brief
introduction to work addressing the intricate relations and
dependencies between tense and aspect and the larger discourse
structure. Let us start with French examples due to Kamp and
Rohrer (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005, ch. 9) and indicate the role
tense and aspect play in discourse organization. Consider sentence
(78) in which the 
passé simple
 (PS) occurs four
times.




78.
 
 
Pierre se
leva, monta dans sa chambre, ferma la porte et alluma la radio.



Pierre got up, went up to his room, closed the door, and switched on
the radio. 





First the PS in (78) provides temporal information; all events are
located in the past. But the PS conveys aspectual information too. It
says that the internal constitution of the events is not important and
this means that PS expresses perfectivity. PS imposes a view of the
events “from the outside”. This is then taken to explain
why multiple uses of the PS imply a succession of the events described
as witnessed in example (78). This means that Pierre getting up
precedes his going up to his room and this event precedes closing the
door which finally precedes turning the radio on. Thus, the PS
structures the above little discourse in a particular way. Early
discourse representation theory explains this effect by assuming that
the PS introduces a new reference point after a previously introduced
one.



The discourse function of the French imparfait is different. Example
(79-a) shows that, like the past in English, the
 imparfait
[
11
]

 is not felicitous when uttered out of the blue.




79.




 (a)


*
Il faisait chaud.



It was hot. 


(b)
 
 
Il faisait
chaud. Jean ôta sa veste.



It was hot. Jean took off his sweater. 







Kamp explains these facts in the following way. The imparfait does not
introduce its own reference time and in (79-a) there is no previous
reference point given. Therefore (79-a) is out. In (79-b) the sentence
in the passé simple 
Jean ôta sa veste
 introduces
a reference time that can be used to anchor 
If faisait chaud
.
The imperfective aspect of the imparfait is then explained by the fact
that the PS event happens while the sentence in the imparfait holds.
Thus passé simple and imparfait not only provide temporal
information but they also serve as means to structure discourse in
different ways.



Dynamic semantics views tense as anaphoric. It relates an
anaphorically given reference time 
t
 to the utterance time 
n

and lexical and grammatical aspect determine the relation between

t
 and the event time 
e
 (see, e.g. Kamp and Reyle 1993). For
English, an event sentence in the past introduces three conditions: 1)
that the event time 
e
 is included in the reference time 
t
, 2)
that 
t
 follows an anaphorically given reference time 
t'

resolved to the reference time of the previous sentence and 3) that

t
 is located before the speech time 
n
. The second condition
guarantees forward movement of the narrative. Thus, a sequence of
event sentences in the past translates into a sequence of completed
events. For stative sentences, the semantics is different. Here the
reference time is resolved to the reference time of the preceding
sentence, and furthermore the state includes this reference time,
which still lies in the past of 
n
. The following examples (from
Asher and Lascarides 2003, p. 62) illustrate this point. Sentence
(80-a) is most naturally interpreted as narrative progression similar
to (78), but the state described in the second sentence of (80-b) is
most naturally understood as the narrative background for the event of
Max entering the room.




80.




 (a)


Max entered the room. The room became dark. 


(b)
 
 Max entered the room. The room was dark. 







For (80-a) and (80-b), the interpretations proposed by Kamp and Reyle
are well in accordance with our intuitions. However, it has repeatedly
been noted, for instance, by Asher and Lascarides (Lascarides and
Asher 1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003) that the analysis often fails
to make the right predictions. The contrast in (81) from Asher
and Lascarides (2003) involves sentences with identical forms and
aspectual properties. However, their temporal interpretations are
rather different. In (81-a) the pushing probably preceded the falling,
but in (81-b) the temporal order is different, here falling precedes
helping him up.




81.




 (a)


Max fell. John pushed him. 


(b)
 
 Max fell. John helped him up. 







This difference can easily be explained, once we take the coherence
relations between the discourse units into account. In (81-a) the two
sentences stand in an EXPLANATION relation to each other, whereas in
(81-b) we are dealing with a NARRATION or RESULT relation. Since causes
cannot follow their effects, the temporal ordering follows from these
discourse relations. More generally, many discourse relations
underlying discourse cohesion impose temporal constraints on the
interpretation of discourse. Asher and Lascarides (2003) amend the
semantics of DRT and extend DRT to 
Segmented Discourse
Representation Theory
 (SDRT) with individual sentences
represented as single discourse representation structures
(micro-DRSes) and a macro dicourse representation structure providing
hierarchical discourse structures organized by means of discourse
relations or rhethorical relations. In SDRT, discourse relations are
inferred employing non-monotonic logic. Much of temporal
interpretation follows from the semantic effects of these discourse
relations. To give a brief impression of the temporal consequences of
discourse relations, (82) shows the temporal consequences of
EXPLANATION (from Asher and Lascarides 1993, p. 160).




82.




 (a)


 

\phi_{Explanation(\alpha, \beta)} \Rightarrow \neg (e_{\alpha} \prec
e_{\beta})
 


(b)
 
 
 \phi_{Explanation(\alpha, \beta)}
\Rightarrow (event(e_{\beta}) \Rightarrow e_{\beta} \prec
e_{\alpha})
 







The temporal consequences of EXPLANATION depend on whether
the second sentence is eventive or not. For an eventive
sentence such as in (81-a) the combination of (82-a/b) make sure
that this event (e.g., pushing) precedes the eventuality introduced by
the first sentence (e.g., falling). In the case of a stative
cause (e.g., 
Max fell. The road was icy.
), the
interpretation is slighly different. Here, it is just guaranteed that
the stative cause does not follow its effect. Let us turn to the
spatiotemporal consequences of NARRATION (ibid., p. 163). Here is a
somewhat simplified characterisation ignoring for the moment that the
prestate of the second eventuality is commonly linked to the
consequent state of the first one by adverbials (e.g. 
five minutes
later
 or 
near the building
).




83.
 

\phi_{Narration(\alpha, \beta)} \Rightarrow
overlap(prestate(e_{\beta}),consequent\
state(e_{\alpha}))





The spatiotemporal consequences of NARRATION in turn should constrain
the aspectual properties of the verbs appearing in the sentences.
Altshuler (2012) observed that imperfective aspect in Russian
should in fact be incompatible with sequences of events in a NARRATION
relation which make reference to complete events. In fact,
aspectual information should in turn have a strong impact on the
discourse relations inferred for discourse in the absence of explicit
marking of relations via discourse connectives. Altshuler (2012; p.
61) discusses the following example in Russian.




84.




(a)
 
Nedelju
nazad Marija po-celova-l-a Dudkina.



Week ago Maria PFV-kissed-PST.3S-FEM Dudkin


‘A week ago, Maria kissed Dudkin.’


(b)
 
 
On dari-l
ej cvety



He give.IPF-PST.3S her flowers.


‘He had given her flowers.’


(c)
 
 
i
priglasa-l ee v teatr.



and invite.IPF-PST.3S her to theatre


‘and had invited her to the theatre.’







With the sequence of a perfective followed by two imperfective
sentences as in (84), the discourse is interpreted not as a NARRATION
sequence but as involving some other discourse relation, most likely
involving an EXPLANATION relation: The fact that Dudkin had given
flowers to Maria and had invited her to the theatre provides an
explanation why he kissed her. Minimally changing the discourse by
using three perfective verb forms instead, has a quite dramatic
effect. Now the discourse is a sequence of NARRATIONs and the kissing
happens before the giving flowers which in turn precedes the
invitation to the theatre. See also Gehrke (2022) for similar claims
made for Russian and Czech, despite existing functional
differences in aspect functions between these languages.



The English example in (85) illustrates a similar effect due to the
contrast between an eventive sentence in the simple past vs. the
past progressive. Depending on tense and aspect the discourse is
most naturally understood as NARRATION in (85-a) or as BACKGROUND
in (85-b).




85.
 


(a)


 Max entered
the building. He whistled a song.


(b)
 Max entered the building. He was whistling a
song.







Experimental work looking into the effects of aspect marking on
discourse coherence is consistent with these claims from the
theoretical literature. Kehler et al. 2008 (see also Ferretti et al.
2009 for ERP evidence) conducted story continuation experiments
testing English transfer-of-possession verbs such as 
Mary
gave John the book
 or 
Mary got the book from
John 
which they tested both in their simple past form as
well as in the progressive triggering an imperfective interpretation.
With these verbs, commonly a so-called goal bias effect is observed,
that is, participants tend to continue the discourse about the goal
argument and comprehenders expect goal continuations.
For 
give
 this corresponds to the subject, whereas
for 
get
 this is the prepositional object.
Crucially, however, Kehler et al. show that this preference strongly
depends on discourse coherence, here in fact a NARRATION or RESULT
relation. Their experimental studies show that the aspect manipulation
has a predictable effect on coherence relations—imperfective
aspect leads to less NARRATION or RESULT relations—and this in
turn affects referential preferences with weaker corefererence goal
biases for progressive transfer-of-possession predicates than for
perfective ones. Their studies thus provide experimental support
for the intricate relations assumed to exist between discourse
structure and aspectual properties but also referential
interpretation in discourse processing.



Of course these brief remarks about the discourse function of tense
and aspect barely touch the tip of the iceberg. For more information
on the discourse semantics of temporality and discourse
organization in general, the reader is advised to consult de Swart and
Corblin (2002), Asher and Lascarides (2003) and van Lambalgen and Hamm
(2005, especially chapter 9).


10. Conclusion



This short note on discourse structure completes our article on tense
and aspect. As noted in various places, this entry could only cover
small parts of the vast literature on tense and aspect in philosophy,
linguistics, psychology and computational modeling. In all
mentioned fields this still is an active research area with many
questions still unresolved. Further information the reader is
advised to consult the references as well as the other internet
resources listed below.
