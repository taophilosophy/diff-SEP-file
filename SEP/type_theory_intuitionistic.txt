Intuitionistic Type Theory
First published Fri Feb 12, 2016; substantive revision Mon Jun 8, 2020




Intuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory or
Martin-Löf type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophical
foundation for
 
constructive mathematics
. It is a
full-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructive
mathematics as
 
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory

 does for
classical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-types
principle and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation
of intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the more
general setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides a
general conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but also
of what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is that
mathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions are
explained in terms of concepts from programming such as data
structures, data types and programs. This article describes the formal
system of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations.


In this entry, we first give an overview of the most important
aspects of intuitionistic type theory—a kind of “extended
abstract”. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhat
familiar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for a
reader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar with
traditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,
arithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce several
aspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from these
traditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of the
theory, close to Martin-Löf’s first published version from
1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2
will now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 then
presents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. In
particular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (and
inductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlying
philosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed by
Martin-Löf. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,
Section 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. In
Section 7 finally, we describe several important variations of the
core Martin-Löf “intensional” theory described in
Section 3 and 4.

1. Overview


We begin with a bird’s eye view of some important aspects of
intuitionistic type theory. Readers who are unfamiliar with the theory
may prefer to skip it on a first reading.


The origins of intuitionistic type theory are Brouwer’s
intuitionism and Russell’s type theory. Like
 
Church’s classical simple theory of types

 it is based on the lambda calculus with types,
but differs from it in that it is based on the propositions-as-types
principle, discovered by Curry (1958) for propositional logic and
extended to predicate logic by Howard (1980) and de Bruijn
(1970). This extension was made possible by the introduction of
indexed families of types (dependent types) for representing the
predicates of predicate logic. In this way all logical connectives and
quantifiers can be interpreted by type formers. In intuitionistic type
theory further types are added, such as a type of natural numbers, a
type of small types (a universe) and a type of well-founded trees. The
resulting theory contains intuitionistic number theory (Heyting
arithmetic) and much more.


The theory is formulated in natural deduction where the rules for
each type former are classified as formation, introduction,
elimination, and equality rules. These rules exhibit certain
symmerties between the introduction and elimination rules following
Gentzen’s and Prawitz’ treatment of natural deduction, 
as explained in the entry on
 
proof-theoretic semantics
.


The elements of propositions, when interpreted as types, are
called 
proof-objects
. When proof-objects are added to the
natural deduction calculus it becomes a typed lambda calculus with
dependent types, which extends Church’s original typed lambda
calculus. The equality rules are computation rules for the terms of
this calculus. Each function definable in the theory is total and
computable. Intuitionistic type theory is thus a typed functional
programming language with the unusual property that all programs
terminate.


Intuitionistic type theory is not only a formal logical system but
also provides a comprehensive philosophical framework for
intuitionism. It is an 
interpreted language
, where the
distinction between the 
demonstration of a judgment
 and
the 
proof of a proposition
 plays a fundamental role (Sundholm
2012). The framework clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov
interpretation of intuitionistic logic and extends it to the more
general setting of intuitionistic type theory. In doing so it provides
a general conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but
also of what a constructive mathematical object is. The meaning of the
judgments of intuitionistic type theory is explained in terms of
computations of the canonical forms of types and terms. These
informal, intuitive meaning explanations are
“pre-mathematical” and should be contrasted to formal
mathematical models developed inside a standard mathematical framework
such as set theory.


This meaning theory also justifies a variety of inductive,
recursive, and inductive-recursive definitions. Although
proof-theoretically strong notions can be justified, such as analogues
of certain large cardinals, the system is considered
predicative. Impredicative definitions of the kind found in
higher-order logic, intuitionistic set theory, and topos theory are
not part of the theory. Neither is Markov’s principle, and thus the
theory is distinct from Russian constructivism.


An alternative formal logical system for predicative constructive
mathematics is Myhill and Aczel’s
 
constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory

 (CZF). This theory, which is based on
intuitionistic first-order predicate logic and weakens some of the
axioms of classical Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, has a natural
interpretation in intuitionistic type theory. Martin-Löf’s meaning
explanations thus also indirectly form a basis for CZF.


Variants of intuitionistic type theory underlie several widely used
proof assistants, including NuPRL, Coq, and Agda. These proof
assistants are computer systems that have been used for formalizing
large and complex proofs of mathematical theorems, such as the Four
Colour Theorem in graph theory and the Feit-Thompson Theorem in finite
group theory. They have also been used to prove the correctness of a realistic C compiler (Leroy 2009) and other 
computer software.


Philosophically and practically, intuitionistic type theory is a
foundational framework where constructive mathematics and computer
programming are, in a deep sense, the same. This point has been
emphasized by (Gonthier 2008) in the paper in which he describes his
proof of the Four Colour Theorem:




The approach that proved successful for this proof was to turn
almost every mathematical concept into a data structure or a program
in the Coq system, thereby converting the entire enterprise into one
of program verification.




2. Propositions as Types


2.1 Intuitionistic Type Theory: a New Way of Looking at Logic?


Intuitionistic type theory offers a new way of analyzing logic,
mainly through its introduction of explicit proof objects. This
provides a direct computational interpretation of logic, since there
are computation rules for proof objects. As regards expressive power,
intuitionistic type theory may be considered as an extension of
first-order logic, much as higher order logic, but predicative.


2.1.1 A Type Theory


Russell developed
 
type theory
 in response to his discovery
of a paradox in naive set theory. In his ramified type theory
mathematical objects are classified according to their 
types
:
the type of propositions, the type of objects, the type of properties
of objects, etc. When Church developed his
 
simple theory of types
 on the
 basis of a typed version of his lambda calculus he added
the rule that there is a type of functions between any two types of
the theory. Intuitionistic type theory further extends the simply
typed lambda calculus with dependent types, that is, indexed families
of types. An example is the family of types of 
n
-tuples indexed by

n
.


Types have been widely used in programming for a long time. Early
high-level programming languages introduced types of integers and
floating point numbers. Modern programming languages often have rich
type systems with many constructs for forming new
types. Intuitionistic type theory is a functional programming language
where the type system is so rich that practically any conceivable
property of a program can be expressed as a type. Types can thus be
used as specifications of the task of a program.


2.1.2 An intuitionstic logic with proof-objects


Brouwer’s analysis of logic led him to an intuitionistic logic
which rejects the law of excluded middle and the law of double
negation. These laws are not valid in intuitionistic type theory. Thus
it does not contain classical (Peano) arithmetic but only
intuitionistic (Heyting) arithmetic. (It is another matter that Peano
arithmetic can be interpreted in Heyting arithmetic by the double
negation interpretation, see the entry on
 
intuitionistic logic
.)


Consider a theorem of intuitionistic arithmetic, such as the
division theorem


∀
m
,
n
.
m
>
0
⊃
∃
q
,
r
.
m
q
+
r
=
n
∧
m
>
r


A formal proof (in the usual sense) of this theorem is a sequence
(or tree) of formulas, where the last (root) formula is the theorem
and each formula in the sequence is either an axiom (a leaf) or the
result of applying an inference rule to some earlier (higher)
formulas.


When the division theorem is proved in intuitionistic type theory,
we do not only build a formal proof in the usual sense but also
a 
construction
 (or 
proof-object
)
“
div
” which witnesses the truth of the theorem. We
write


div
:
∀
m
,
n
:
N
.
m
>
0
⊃
∃
q
,
r
:
N
.
m
q
+
r
=
n
∧
m
>
r


to express that 
div
 is a proof-object for the division
theorem, that is, an element of the type representing the division
theorem. When propositions are represented as types, the

∀
-quantifier is identified with the dependent function space
former (or general cartesian product) 
Π
, the

∃
-quantifier with the dependent pairs type former (or
general disjoint sum) 
Σ
, conjunction 
∧
 with cartesian product 
×
, the identity relation = with the
type former 
I
 of proof-objects of identities, and the greater
than relation 
>
 with the type former 
GT
 of
proof-objects of greater-than statements. Using
“type-notation” we thus write


div
:
Π
m
,
n
:
N
.
GT
(
m
,
0
)
→
Σ
q
,
r
:
N
.
I
(
N
,
m
q
+
r
,
n
)
×
GT
(
m
,
r
)


to express that the proof object “
div
” is a
function which maps two numbers 
m
 and 
n
 and a proof-object 
p
 witnessing that

m
>
0
 to a quadruple 
(
q
,
(
r
,
(
s
,
t
)
)
)
, where 
q
 is the quotient
and 
r
 is the remainder obtained when dividing 
n
 by 
m
. The
third component 
s
 is a proof-object witnessing the fact that 
m
q
+
r
=
n
 and the fourth component 
t
 is a proof object witnessing 
m
>
r
.


Crucially, 
div
 is not only a function in the classical sense;
it is also a function in the intuitionistic sense, that is, a program
which computes the output 
(
q
,
(
r
,
(
s
,
t
)
)
)
 when given 
m
, 
n
, 
p

as inputs. This program is a term in a lambda calculus with special
constants, that is, a program in a functional programming
language.


2.1.3 An extension of first-order predicate logic


Intuitionistic type theory can be considered as an extension of
first-order logic, much as higher order logic is an extension of first
order logic. In higher order logic we find some individual domains
which can be interpreted as any sets we like. If there are relational
constants in the signature these can be interpreted as any relations
between the sets interpreting the individual domains. On top of that
we can quantify over relations, and over relations of relations,
etc. We can think of higher order logic as first-order logic equipped
with a way of introducing new domains of quantification: if 
S
1
,
…
,
S
n
 are domains of quantification then 
(
S
1
,
…
,
S
n
)

is a new domain of quantification consisting of all the n-ary
relations between the domains 
S
1
,
…
,
S
n
. Higher order logic
has a straightforward set-theoretic interpretation where

(
S
1
,
…
,
S
n
)
 is interpreted as the power set 
P
(
A
1
×
⋯
×
A
n
)
 where 
A
i
 is the interpretation of 
S
i
,
for 
i
=
1
,
…
,
n
. This is the kind of higher order logic or simple
theory of types that Ramsey, Church and others introduced.


Intuitionistic type theory can be viewed in a similar way, only
here the possibilities for introducing domains of quantification are
richer, one can use 
Σ
,
Π
,
+
,
I
 to construct new ones from
old. (
Section 3.1
; Martin-Löf 1998
[1972]). Intuitionistic type theory has a straightforward
set-theoretic interpretation as well, where 
Σ
, 
Π
 etc
are interpreted as the corresponding set-theoretic constructions; see
below. We can add to intuitionistic type theory unspecified individual
domains just as in HOL. These are interpreted as sets as for HOL. Now
we exhibit a difference from HOL: in intuitionistic type theory we can
introduce unspecified family symbols. We can introduce 
T
 as a
family of types over the individual domain 
S
:


T
(
x
)
t
y
p
e
(
x
:
S
)
.


If 
S
 is interpreted as 
A
, 
T
 can be interpreted as any
family of sets indexed by 
A
. As a non-mathematical example, we can
render the binary relation 
loves
 between members of an
individual domain of 
people
 as follows. Introduce the binary
family Loves over the domain People


L
o
v
e
s
(
x
,
y
)
t
y
p
e
(
x
:
P
e
o
p
l
e
,
y
:
P
e
o
p
l
e
)
.


The interpretation can be any family of sets 
B
x
,
y
 (
x
:
A
,

y
:
A
). How does this cover the standard notion of relation? Suppose
we have a binary relation 
R
 on 
A
 in the familiar set-theoretic
sense. We can make a binary family corresponding to this as
follows


B
x
,
y
=
{
{
0
}
if 
R
(
x
,
y
)
 holds
∅
if 
R
(
x
,
y
)
 is false.


Now clearly 
B
x
,
y
 is nonempty if and only if 
R
(
x
,
y
)

holds. (We could have chosen any other element from our set theoretic
universe than 0 to indicate truth.) Thus from any relation we can
construct a family whose truth of 
x
,
y
 is equivalent to 
B
x
,
y

being non-empty. Note that this interpretation does not care what the
proof for 
R
(
x
,
y
)
 is, just that it holds. Recall that
intuitionistic type theory interprets propositions as types, so 

p
:
L
o
v
e
s
(
J
o
h
n
,
M
a
r
y
)
 means that 
L
o
v
e
s
(
J
o
h
n
,
M
a
r
y
)
 is true.


The interpretation of relations as families allows for keeping
track of proofs or evidence that 
R
(
x
,
y
)
 holds, but we may also
chose to ignore it.


In 
Montague semantics
,
 higher order logic is used to give
semantics of natural language (and examples as above). Ranta (1994)
introduced the idea to instead employ intuitionistic type theory to
better capture sentence structure with the help of dependent
types.


In contrast, how would the mathematical relation 
>
 between
natural numbers be handled in intuitionistic type theory? First of all
we need a type of numbers 
N
. We could in principle introduce an
unspecified individual domain 
N
, and then add axioms just as we
do in first-order logic when we set up the axiom system for Peano
arithmetic. However this would not give us the desirable computational
interpretation. So as explained below we lay down introduction rules
for constructing new natural numbers in 
N
 and elimination and
computation rules for defining functions on 
N
 (by recursion). The
standard order relation 
>
 should satisfy


x
>
y
 iff there exists 
z
:
N
 such that 
y
+
z
+
1
=
x
.


The right hand is rendered as 
Σ
z
:
N
.
I
(
N
,
y
+
z
+
1
,
x
)
 in
intuitionistic type theory, and we take this as definition of relation

>
. (
+
 is defined by recursive equations, 
I
 is the
identity type construction). Now all the properties of 
>
 are
determined by the mentioned introduction and elimination and
computation rules for 
N
.


2.1.4 A logic with several forms of judgment


The type system of intuitionistic type theory is very
expressive. As a consequence the well-formedness of a type is no
longer a simple matter of parsing, it is something which needs to be
proved. Well-formedness of a type is one form of 
judgment
 of
intuitionistic type theory. Well-typedness of a term with respect to a
type is another. Furthermore, there are equality judgments for types
and terms. This is yet another way in which intuitionistic type theory
differs from ordinary first order logic with its focus on the sole
judgment expressing the truth of a proposition.


2.1.5 Semantics


While a standard presentation of first-order logic would follow
Tarski in defining the notion of model, intuitionistic type theory
follows the tradition of Brouwerian meaning theory as further
developed by Heyting and Kolmogorov, the so called BHK-interpretation
of logic. The key point is that the proof of an implication 
A
⊃
B
 is a 
method
 that transforms a proof of 
A
 to
a proof of 
B
. In intuitionistic type theory this method is
formally represented by the program 
f
:
A
⊃
B
 or 
f
:
A
→
B
: the type of proofs of an implication 
A
⊃
B

is the type of functions which maps proofs of 
A
 to proofs of

B
.


Moreover, whereas Tarski semantics is usually presented
meta-mathematically, and assumes set theory, Martin-Löf’s meaning
theory of intuitionistic type theory should be understood directly and
“pre-mathematically”, that is, without assuming a
meta-language such as set theory.


2.1.6 A functional programming language


Readers with a background in the lambda calculus and functional
programming can get an alternative first approximation of
intuitionistic type theory by thinking about it as a typed functional
programming language in the style of Haskell or one of the dialects of
ML. However, it differs from these in two crucial aspects: (i) it has
dependent types (see below) and (ii) all typable programs
terminate. (Note that intuitionistic type theory has influenced recent
extensions of Haskell with 
generalized algebraic datatypes

which sometimes can play a similar role as inductively defined
dependent types.)


2.2 The Curry-Howard Correspondence


As already mentioned, the principle that




a proposition is the type of its proofs.




is fundamental to intuitionistic type theory. This principle is
also known as the Curry-Howard correspondence or even Curry-Howard
isomorphism. Curry discovered a correspondence between the
implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic and the simply typed
lambda-calculus. Howard extended this correspondence to first-order
predicate logic. In intuitionistic type theory this correspondence
becomes an 
identification
 of proposition and types, which has
been extended to include quantification over higher types and
more.


2.3 Sets of Proof-Objects


So what are these proof-objects like? They should not be thought of
as logical derivations, but rather as some (structured) symbolic
evidence that something is true. Another term for such evidence is
“truth-maker”.


It is instructive, as a somewhat crude first approximation, to
replace types by ordinary sets in this correspondence. Define a set

E
m
,
n
, depending on 
m
,
n
∈
N
, by:


E
m
,
n
=
{
{
0
}
if 
m
=
n
∅
if 
m
≠
n
.


Then 
E
m
,
n
 is nonempty exactly when 
m
=
n
. The set

E
m
,
n
 corresponds to the proposition 
m
=
n
, and the number

0
 is a proof-object (truth-maker) inhabiting the sets

E
m
,
m
.


Consider the proposition that 
m
 is an even number

expressed as the formula 
∃
n
∈
N
.
m
=
2
n
. We
can build a set of proof-objects corresponding to this formula by
using the general set-theoretic sum operation. Suppose that 
A
n

(
n
∈
N
) is a family of sets. Then its disjoint sum is
given by the set of pairs


(
Σ
n
∈
N
)
A
n
=
{
(
n
,
a
)
:
n
∈
N
,
a
∈
A
n
}
.


If we apply this construction to the family 
A
n
=
E
m
,
2
n
 we
see that 
(
Σ
n
∈
N
)
E
m
,
2
n
 is nonempty exactly
when there is an 
n
∈
N
 with 
m
=
2
n
. Using the
general set-theoretic product operation 
(
Π
n
∈
N
)
A
n
 we can similarly obtain a set corresponding to a universally
quantified proposition.


2.4 Dependent Types


In intuitionistic type theory there are primitive type formers

Σ
 and 
Π
 for general sums and products, and 
I
 for
identity types, analogous to the set-theoretic constructions described
above. The 
identity type
 
I
(
N
,
m
,
n
)
 corresponding to the
set 
E
m
,
n
 is an example of a 
dependent type
 since it
depends on 
m
 and 
n
. It is also called an 
indexed family of
types
 since it is a family of types indexed by 
m
 and

n
. Similarly, we can form the general disjoint sum 
Σ
x
:
A
.
B
 and the general cartesian product 
Π
x
:
A
.
B
 of such a
family of types 
B
 indexed by 
x
:
A
, corresponding to the set
theoretic sum and product operations above.


Dependent types can also be defined by primitive recursion. An
example is the type of 
n
-tuples 
A
n
 of elements of type 
A

and indexed by 
n
:
N
 defined by the equations


A
0
=
1
A
n
+
1
=
A
×
A
n


 where 
1
 is a
one element type and 
×
 denotes the cartesian product of two
types. We note that dependent types introduce computation in types:
the defining rules above are computation rules. For example, the
result of computing 
A
3
 is 
A
×
(
A
×
(
A
×
1
)
)
.


2.5 Propositions as Types in Intuitionistic Type Theory


With propositions as types, predicates become dependent types. For
example, the predicate 
Prime
(
x
)
 becomes the type of
proofs that 
x
 is prime. This type 
depends
 on

x
. Similarly, 
x
<
y
 is the type of proofs that 
x
 is
less than 
y
.


According to the Curry-Howard interpretation of propositions as
types, the logical constants are interpreted as type formers:


⊥
=
∅
⊤
=
1
A
∨
B
=
A
+
B
A
∧
B
=
A
×
B
A
⊃
B
=
A
→
B
∃
x
:
A
.
B
=
Σ
x
:
A
.
B
∀
x
:
A
.
B
=
Π
x
:
A
.
B



where 
Σ
x
:
A
.
B
 is the
disjoint sum of the 
A
-indexed family of types 
B
 and 
Π
x
:
A
.
B
 is its cartesian product. The canonical elements of 
Σ
x
:
A
.
B
 are pairs 
(
a
,
b
)
 such that 
a
:
A
 and 
b
:
B
[
x
:=
a
]

(the type obtained by substituting all free occurrences of 
x
 in

B
 by 
a
). The elements of 
Π
x
:
A
.
B
 are (computable)
functions 
f
 such that 
f
a
:
B
[
x
:=
a
]
, whenever 
a
:
A
.


For example, consider the proposition


(1)
∀
m
:
N
.
∃
n
:
N
.
m
<
n
∧
Prime
(
n
)




expressing that there are
arbitrarily large primes. Under the Curry-Howard interpretation this
becomes the type 
Π
m
:
N
.
Σ
n
:
N
.
m
<
n
×
Prime
(
n
)
 of functions which map a number 
m
 to a triple

(
n
,
(
p
,
q
)
)
, where 
n
 is a number, 
p
 is a proof that 
m
<
n
 and 
q
 is a proof that 
n
 is prime. This is the 
proofs
as programs
 principle: a constructive proof that there are
arbitrarily large primes becomes a program which given any number
produces a larger prime together with proofs that it indeed is larger
and indeed is prime.


Note that the proof which derives a contradiction from the
assumption that there is a largest prime is not constructive, since it
does not explicitly give a way to compute an even larger prime. To
turn this proof into a constructive one we have to show explicitly how
to construct the larger prime. (Since proposition (
1
) above
is a 
Π
2
0
-formula we can for example use Friedman’s
A-translation to turn such a proof in classical arithmetic into a
proof in intuitionistic arithmetic and thus into a proof in
intuitionistic type theory.)


3. Basic Intuitionistic Type Theory


We now present a core version of intuitionistic type theory,
closely related to the first version of the theory presented by
Martin-Löf in 1972 (Martin-Löf 1998 [1972]). In addition to
the type formers needed for the Curry-Howard interpretation of typed
intuitionistic predicate logic listed above, we have two types: the
type 
N
 of natural numbers and the type 
U
 of small types.


The resulting theory can be shown to contain intuitionistic number
theory 
HA
 (Heyting arithmetic), Gödel’s System 
T
 of
primitive recursive functions of higher type, and the theory

HA
ω
 of Heyting arithmetic of higher type.


This core intuitionistic type theory is not only the original one,
but perhaps the minimal version which exhibits the essential features
of the theory. Later extensions with primitive identity types,
well-founded tree types, universe hierarchies, and general notions of
inductive and inductive-recursive definitions have increased the
proof-theoretic strength of the theory and also made it more
convenient for programming and formalization of mathematics. For
example, with the addition of well-founded trees we can interpret the
Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory 
CZF
 of Aczel
(1978 [1977]). However, we will
wait until the next section to describe those extensions.


3.1 Judgments


In Martin-Löf (1996) a general philosophy of logic is presented
where the traditional notion of judgment is expanded and given a
central position. A judgment is no longer just an affirmation or
denial of a proposition, but a general act of knowledge. When
reasoning mathematically we make judgments about mathematical
objects. One form of judgment is to state that some mathematical
statement is true. Another form of judgment is to state that something
is a mathematical object, for example a set. The logical rules give
methods for producing correct judgments from earlier judgments. The
judgments obtained by such rules can be presented in tree form


J

or in sequential form

 by rule 
r
3
 from(5) and (6)


(8)
 
J
8
 by rule 
r
4
 from (3) and (7)




The latter form is common in mathematical arguments. Such a
sequence or tree formed by logical rules from axioms is
a 
derivation
 or 
demonstration
 of a judgment.


First-order reasoning may be presented using a single kind of
judgment:




the proposition 
B
 is true under the hypothesis that the
propositions 
A
1
,
…
,
A
n
 are all true.




We write this 
hypothetical judgment
 as a
so-called 
Gentzen sequent


A
1
,
…
,
A
n
⊢
B
.


Note that this is a single judgment that should not be confused with
the derivation of the judgment 
⊢
B
 from the judgments

⊢
A
1
,
…
,
⊢
A
n
. When 
n
=
0
, then
the 
categorical judgment
 
⊢
B
 states that 
B
 is
true without any assumptions. With sequent notation the familiar rule
for conjunctive introduction becomes


A
1
,
…
,
A
n
⊢
B
A
1
,
…
,
A
n
⊢
C
A
1
,
…
,
A
n
⊢
B
∧
C
(
∧
I
)
.


3.2 Judgment Forms


Martin-Löf type theory has four basic forms of judgments and is a
considerably more complicated system than first-order logic. One
reason is that more information is carried around in the derivations
due to the identification of propositions and types. Another reason is
that the syntax is more involved. For instance, the well-formed
formulas (types) have to be generated simultaneously with the provably
true formulas (inhabited types).


The four forms of 
categorical
 judgment are






⊢
A
t
y
p
e
, meaning that 
A
 is a well-formed
type,






⊢
a
:
A
, meaning that 
a
 has type 
A
,






⊢
A
=
A
′
, meaning that 
A
 and 
A
′
 are equal
types,






⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A
, meaning that 
a
 and 
a
′
 are
equal elements of type 
A
.






In general, a judgment is 
hypothetical
, that is, it is
made in a context 
Γ
, that is, a list 
x
1
:
A
1
,
…
,
x
n
:
A
n
 of variables which may occur free in the judgment together
with their respective types. Note that the types in a context can
depend on variables of earlier types. For example, 
A
n
 can depend
on 
x
1
:
A
1
,
…
,
x
n
−
1
:
A
n
−
1
. The four forms of
hypothetical judgments are






Γ
⊢
A
t
y
p
e
, meaning that 
A
 is a
well-formed type in the context 
Γ
,






Γ
⊢
a
:
A
, meaning that 
a
 has type 
A
 in
context 
Γ
,






Γ
⊢
A
=
A
′
, meaning that 
A
 and 
A
′
 are
equal types in the context 
Γ
,






Γ
⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A
, meaning that 
a
 and 
a
′

are equal elements of type 
A
 in the context 
Γ
.






Under the proposition as types interpretation


(2)
⊢
a
:
A



can be understood as the judgment that 
a
 is a proof-object for the
proposition 
A
. When suppressing this object we get a judgment
corresponding to the one in ordinary first-order logic (see
above):


(3)
⊢
A
t
r
u
e
.


Remark 3.1.
 Martin-Löf
(1994) argues that
Kant’s 
analytic judgment a priori
 and 
synthetic judgment
a priori
 can be exemplified, in the realm of logic, by
([analytic]) and ([synthetic]) respectively. In the analytic judgment
([analytic]) everything that is needed to make the judgment evident is
explicit. For its synthetic version ([synthetic]) a possibly
complicated proof construction 
a
 needs to be provided to make it
evident. This understanding of analyticity and syntheticity has the
surprising consequence that “the logical laws in their usual
formulation are all synthetic.” Martin-Löf (1994:
95). His analysis further
gives:


 “ […] the logic of analytic judgments,
that is, the logic for deriving judgments of the two analytic forms,
is complete and decidable, whereas the logic of synthetic judgments is
incomplete and undecidable, as was shown by Gödel.”
Martin-Löf (1994: 97).



 The decidability of the two analytic judgments (
⊢
a
:
A
 and

⊢
a
=
b
:
A
) hinges on the metamathematical properties of type
theory: strong normalization and decidable type checking. 


Sometimes also the following forms are explicitly considered to be
judgments of the theory:




Γ
c
o
n
t
e
x
t
, meaning that 
Γ
 is a
well-formed context.


Γ
=
Γ
′
, meaning that 
Γ
 and

Γ
′
 are equal contexts.




Below we shall abbreviate the judgment 
Γ
⊢
A
t
y
p
e
 as 
Γ
⊢
A
 and 
Γ
c
o
n
t
e
x
t
 as

Γ
⊢
.


3.3 Inference Rules


When stating the rules we will use the letter 
Γ
 as a
meta-variable ranging over contexts, 
A
,
B
,
…
 as meta-variables
ranging over types, and 
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
…
 as meta-variables
ranging over terms.


The first group of inference rules are general rules including
rules of assumption, substitution, and context formation. There are
also rules which express that equalities are equivalence
relations. There are numerous such rules, and we only show the
particularly important 
rule of type equality
 which is crucial
for computation in types:


Γ
⊢
a
:
A
Γ
⊢
A
=
B
Γ
⊢
a
:
B


The remaining rules are specific to the type formers. These are
classified as formation, introduction, elimination, and equality
rules.


3.4 Intuitionistic Predicate Logic


We only give the rules for 
Π
. There are analogous rules for
the other type formers corresponding to the logical constants of typed
predicate logic.


In the following 
B
[
x
:=
a
]
 means the term obtained by
substituting the term 
a
 for each free occurrence of the variable

x
 in 
B
 (avoiding variable capture).


Π
-formation.


Γ
⊢
A
Γ
,
x
:
A
⊢
B
Γ
⊢
Π
x
:
A
.
B




Π
-introduction.


Γ
,
x
:
A
⊢
b
:
B
Γ
⊢
λ
x
.
b
:
Π
x
:
A
.
B




Π
-elimination.


Γ
⊢
f
:
Π
x
:
A
.
B
Γ
⊢
a
:
A
Γ
⊢
f
a
:
B
[
x
:=
a
]




Π
-equality.


Γ
,
x
:
A
⊢
b
:
B
Γ
⊢
a
:
A
Γ
⊢
(
λ
x
.
b
)
a
=
b
[
x
:=
a
]
:
B
[
x
:=
a
]




This is the rule of 
β
-conversion. We
may also add the rule of 
η
-conversion:


Γ
⊢
f
:
Π
x
:
A
.
B
Γ
⊢
λ
x
.
f
x
=
f
:
Π
x
:
A
.
B
.




Furthermore, there are congruence rules expressing that operations
introduced by the formation, introduction, and elimination rules
preserve equality. For example, the congruence rule for 
Π
 is


Γ
⊢
A
=
A
′
Γ
,
x
:
A
⊢
B
=
B
′
Γ
⊢
Π
x
:
A
.
B
=
Π
x
:
A
′
.
B
′
.


3.5 Natural Numbers


As in Peano arithmetic the natural numbers are generated by 0 and
the successor operation 
s
. The elimination rule states that these
are the only possible ways to generate a natural number.


We write 
f
(
c
)
=
R
(
c
,
d
,
x
y
.
e
)
 for the function which is defined
by primitive recursion on the natural number 
c
 with base case

d
 and step function 
x
y
.
e
 (or alternatively 
λ
x
y
.
e
)
which maps the value 
y
 for the previous number 
x
:
N
 to the
value for 
s
(
x
)
. Note that 
R
 is a new variable-binding
operator: the variables 
x
 and 
y
 become bound in 
e
.


N
-formation.


Γ
⊢
N




N
-introduction.


Γ
⊢
0
:
N
Γ
⊢
a
:
N
Γ
⊢
s
(
a
)
:
N




N
-elimination.
 


Γ
,
x

N
⊢
C
Γ
⊢
c
:
N
Γ
⊢
d
:
C
[
x
:=
0
]
Γ
,
y
:
N
,
z
:
C
[
x
:=
y
]
⊢
e
:
C
[
x
:=
s
(
y
)
]
Γ
⊢
R
(
c
,
d
,
y
z
.
e
)
:
C
[
x
:=
c
]






N
-equality (under appropriate premises).


R
(
0
,
d
,
y
z
.
e
)
=
d
:
C
[
x
:=
0
]
R
(
s
(
a
)
,
d
,
y
z
.
e
)
=
e
[
y
:=
a
,
z
:=
R
(
a
,
d
,
y
z
.
e
)
]
:
C
[
x
:=
s
(
a
)
]




The rule of 
N
-elimination simultaneously expresses the type of
a function defined by primitive recursion and, under the Curry-Howard
interpretation, the rule of mathematical induction: we prove the
property 
C
 of a natural number 
x
 by induction on 
x
.


Gödel’s System 
T
 is essentially intuitionistic type theory with
only the type formers 
N
 and 
A
→
B
 (the type of
functions from 
A
 to 
B
, which is the special case of 

(
Π
x
:
A
)
B
 where 
B
 does not depend on 
x
:
A
). Since there are no
dependent types in System 
T
 the rules can be simplified.


3.6 The Universe of Small Types


Martin-Löf’s first version of type theory (Martin-Löf 1971a) had an
axiom stating that there is a type of all types. This was proved
inconsistent by Girard who found that the Burali-Forti paradox could
be encoded in this theory.


To overcome this pathological impredicativity, but still retain
some of its expressivity, Martin-Löf introduced in 1972 a universe

U
 of small types closed under all type formers of the theory,
except that it does not contain itself (Martin-Löf 1998 [1972]). The rules
are:


U
-formation.


Γ
⊢
U




U
-introduction.


Γ
⊢
∅
:
U
Γ
⊢
1
:
U




Γ

:

Γ

B
:
U
Γ
⊢

×
B
:
U


Γ
⊢
A
:
U
Γ
⊢
B
:
U
Γ
⊢
A
→
B
:
U


Γ
⊢
A

U
Γ
,
x

A

B
:
U
Γ

Σ
x

A
.
B

U
Γ

Γ

x

.
B
:
U


Γ
⊢
N
:
U


U
-elimination.


Γ
⊢
A
:
U
Γ
⊢
A




Since 
U
 is a type, we can use 
N
-elimination to define small
types by primitive recursion. For example, if 
A
:
U
, we can define
the type of 
n
-tuples of elements in 
A
 as follows:


A
n
=
R
(
n
,
1
,
x
y
.
A
×
y
)
:
U


This type-theoretic universe 
U
 is analogous to a Grothendieck
universe in set theory which is a set of sets closed under all the
ways sets can be constructed in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The
existence of a Grothendieck universe cannot be proved from the usual
axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory but needs a new axiom.


In Martin-Löf (1975) the universe is extended to a countable
hierarchy of universes


U
0
:
U
1
:
U
2
:
⋯
.


In this way each type has a type, not only each small type.


3.7 Propositional Identity


Above, we introduced the equality judgment


(4)
Γ
⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A
.



This is usually called a “definitional equality” because
it can be decided by normalizing the terms 
a
 and 
a
′
 and
checking whether the normal forms are identical. However, this
equality is a judgment and not a proposition (type) and we thus cannot
prove such judgmental equalities by induction. For this reason we need
to introduce propositional identity types. For example, the identity
type for natural numbers 
I
(
N
,
m
,
n
)
 can be defined by

U
-valued primitive recursion. We can then express and prove the
Peano axioms. Moreover, extensional equality of ufnctions can be
defined by


I
(
N
→
N
,
f
,
f
′
)
=
Π
x
:
N
.
I
(
N
,
f
x
,
f
′
x
)
.


3.8 The Axiom of Choice is a Theorem


The following form of the axiom of choice is an immediate
consequence of the BHK-interpretation of the intuitionistic
quantifiers, and is easily proved in intuitionistic type theory:


(
Π
x
:
A
.
Σ
y
:
B
.
C
)
→
Σ
f
:
(
Π
x
:
A
.
B
)
.
C
[
y
:=
f
x
]


The reason is that 
Π
x
:
A
.
Σ
y
:
B
.
C
 is the type of
functions which map elements 
x
:
A
 to pairs 
(
y
,
z
)
 with 
y
:
B
 and 
z
:
C
. The choice function 
f
 is obtained by returning
the first component 
y
:
B
 of this pair.


It is perhaps surprising that intuitionistic type theory directly
validates an axiom of choice, since this axiom is often considered
problematic from a constructive point of view. A possible explanation
for this state of affairs is that the above is an axiom of choice
for 
types
, and that types are not in general appropriate
constructive approximations of sets in the classical sense. For
example, we can represent a real number as a Cauchy sequence in
intuitionistic type theory, but the set of real numbers is not the
type of Cauchy sequences, but the type of Cauchy sequences up to
equiconvergence. More generally, a set in Bishop’s constructive
mathematics is represented by a type (commonly called
“preset”) together with an equivalence relation.


If 
A
 and 
B
 are equipped with equivalence relations, there
is of course no guarantee that the choice function, 
f
 above, is
extensional in the sense that it maps equivalent element to equivalent
elements. This is the failure of the 
extensional axiom of
choice
, see Martin-Löf (2009) for an analysis.


4. Extensions


4.1 The Logical Framework


The above completes the description of a core version of
intuitionistic type theory close to that of (Martin-Löf 1998 [1972]).


In 1986 Martin-Löf proposed a reformulation of intuitionistic type
theory; see Nordström, Peterson and Smith (1990) for an
exposition. The purpose was to give a more compact formulation, where

λ
 and 
Π
 are the only variable binding operations. It
is nowadays considered the main version of the theory. It is also the
basis for the Agda proof assistant. The 1986 theory has two parts:






the theory of types (the logical framework);






the theory of sets (small types).






Remark 4.1.
 Note that the word
“set” in the logical framework does not coincide with the
way it is used in Bishop’s constructive mathematics. To avoid this
confusion, types together with equivalence relations are usually
called “setoids” or “extensional sets” in
intuitionistic type theory.


The logical framework has only two type formers: 
Π
x
:
A
.
B

(usually written 
(
x
:
A
)
B
 or 
(
x
:
A
)
→
B
 in the
logical framework formulation) and 
U
 (usually called

Set
). The rules for 
Π
x
:
A
.
B
 (
(
x
:
A
)
→
B
)
are the same as given above (including 
η
-conversion). The rules
for 
U
 (
Set
) are also the same, except that the logical
framework only stipulates closure under 
Π
-type formation.


The other small type formers (“set formers”) are
introduced in the theory of sets. In the logical framework formulation
each formation, introduction, and elimination rule can be expressed as
the typing of a new constant. For example, the rules for natural
numbers become




N
:
Set
,
0
:
N
,
s
:
N
→
N
,
R
:
(
C
:
N
→
Set
)
→
C
0
→
(
(
x
:
N
)
→
C
x
→
C
(
s
x
)
)
→
(
c
:
N
)
→
C
c
.





where we have omitted the common context 
Γ
, since the types
of these constants are closed. Note that the recursion operator 
R

has a first argument 
C
:
N
→
Set
 unlike in the
original formulation.


Moreover, the equality rules can be expressed as equations


R
C
d
e
0
=
d
:
C
0
R
C
d
e
(
s
a
)
=
e
a
(
R
C
d
e
a
)
:
C
(
s
a
)


under suitable assumptions.


In the sequel we will present several extensions of type theory. To
keep the presentation uniform we will however 
not
 use the
logical framework presentation of type theory, but will use the same
notation as in 
section 2
.


4.2 A General Identity Type Former


As we mentioned above, identity on natural numbers can be defined
by primitive recursion. Identity relations on other types can also be
defined in the basic version of intuitionistic type theory presented
in 
section 2
.


However, Martin-Löf (1975) extended intuitionistic type theory with
a uniform primitive identity type former 
I
 for all types. The
rules for 
I
 express that the identity relation is inductively
generated by the proof of reflexivity, a canonicial constant called

r
. (Note that 
r
 was coded by the number 0 in the introductory
presentation of proof-objects
in 
2.3
. The elimination rule for the identity type is a
generalization of identity elimination in predicate logic and
introduces an elimination constant 
J
. We here show the
formulation due to Paulin-Mohring (1993) rather than the
original formulation of Martin-Löf (1975). The inference rules are
the following.

[
x
:=
b
,
y
:=
c
]




I
-equality (under appropriate assumptions).


J

r
,

)

d


Note that if 
C
 only depends on 
x
:
A
 and not on the proof 
y
:
I
(
A
,
a
,
x
)
 (and we also suppress proof objects) in the rule of 
I
-elimination we recover the rule of identity elimination in predicate logic.


By constructing a model of type theory where types are interpreted
as 
groupoids
 (categories where all arrows are isomorphisms)
Hofmann and Streicher (1998) showed that it cannot be proved in
intuitionistic type theory that all proofs of 
I
(
A
,
a
,
b
)
 are
identical. This may seem as an incompleteness of the theory and
Streicher suggested a new axiom 
K
 from which it follows that all
proofs of 
I
(
A
,
a
,
b
)
 are identical to 
r
.


The 
I
-type is often called the 
intensional identity
type
, since it does not satisfy the principle of function
extensionality. Intuitionistic type theory with the intensional
identity type is also often called 
intensional intuitionistic type
theory
 to distinguish it from 
extensional intuitionistic type
theory
 which will be presented in
 
section 7.1
.


4.3 Well-Founded Trees


A type of well-founded trees of the form 
W
x
:
A
.
B
 was
introduced in Martin-Löf 1982 (and in a more restricted form by Scott
1970). Elements of 
W
x
:
A
.
B
 are trees of varying and arbitrary
branching: varying, because the branching type 
B
 is indexed by 
x
:
A
 and arbitrary because 
B
 can be arbitrary. The type is given
by a 
generalized inductive definition
 since the well-founded
trees may be infinitely branching. We can think of 
W
x
:
A
.
B
 as the
free term algebra, where each 
a
:
A
 represents a term constructor

sup
a
 with (possibly infinite) arity

x

a
]
.

,

)
:

We omit the rules of 
W
-elimination and 
W
-equality.


Adding well-founded trees to intuitionistic type theory increases
its proof-theoretic strength significantly (Setzer
(1998)).


4.4 Iterative Sets and CZF


An important application of well-founded trees is Aczel’s (1978)
construction of a type-theoretic model of Constructive Zermelo
Fraenkel Set Theory. To this end he defines the type of iterative sets
as


V
=
W
x
:
U
.
x
.


Let 
A
:
U
 be a small type, and 
x
:
A
⊢
M
 be an indexed
family of iterative sets. Then 
sup
(
A
,
x
.
M
)
, or with a more
suggestive notation 
{
M
∣
x
:
A
}
, is an iterative set. To
paraphrase: an iterative set is a family of iterative sets indexed by a small type.


Note that an iterative set is a data-structure in the sense of
functional programming: a possibly infinitely branching well-founded
tree. Different trees may represent the same set. We therefore need to
define a notion of extensional equality between iterative sets which
disregards repetition and order of elements. This definition is
formally similar to the definition of bisimulation of processes in
process algebra. The type 
V
 up to extensional equality can be
viewed as a constructive type-theoretic model of the cumulative
hierarchy, see the entry on 
  
set theory: constructive and intuitionistic ZF

for further information about CZF.


4.5 Inductive Definitions


The notion of an inductive definition is fundamental in
intuitionistic type theory. It is a primitive notion and not, as in
set theory, a derived notion where an inductively defined set is
defined impredicatively as the smallest set closed under some
rules. However, in intuitionistic type theory inductive definitions
are considered predicative: they are viewed as being built up from
below.


The inductive definability of types is inherent in the meaning
explanations of intuitionistic type theory which we shall discuss in
the next section. In fact, intuitionistic type theory can be described
briefly as a theory of inductive, recursive, and inductive-recursive
definitions based on a framework of lambda calculus with dependent
types.


We have already seen the type of natural numbers and the type of
well-founded trees as examples of types given by inductive
definitions; the natural numbers is an example of an ordinary finitary
inductive definition and the well-founded trees of a generalized
possibly infinitary inductive definition. The introduction rules
describe how elements of these types are inductively generated and the
elimination and equality rules describe how functions from these types
can be defined by structural recursion on the way these elements are
generated. According to the propositions as types principle, the
elimination rules are simultaneously rules for proof by structural
induction on the way the elements are generated.


The type formers 
0
,
1
,
+
,
×
,
→
,
Σ
,
 and

Π
 which interpret the logical constants for intuitionistic
predicate logic are examples of degenerate inductive definitions. Even
the identity type (in intensional intuitionistic type theory) is
inductively generated; it is the type of proofs generated by the
reflexivity axiom. Its elimination rule expresses proof by pattern
matching on the proof of reflexivity.


The common structure of the rules of the type formers can be
captured by a general schema for inductive definitions (Dybjer
1991). This general schema has many useful instances, for example, the
type 
List
(
A
)
 of lists with elements of type 
A
 has the
following introduction rules:


Γ
⊢
nil
:
List
(
A
)
Γ
⊢
a
:
A
Γ
⊢
a
s
:
List
(
A
)
Γ
⊢
cons
(
a
,
a
s
)
:
List
(
A
)


Other useful instances are types of binary trees and other trees
such as the infinitely branching trees of the Brouwer ordinals of the
second and higher number classes.


The general schema does not only cover inductively defined types,
but also inductively defined families of types, such as the identity
relation. The above mentioned type 
A
n
 of 
n
-tuples of type

A
 was defined above by primitive recursion on 
n
. It can also
be defined as an inductive family with the following introduction
rules


Γ
⊢
nil
:
A
0
Γ
⊢
a
:
A
Γ
⊢
a
s
:
A
n
Γ
⊢
cons
(
a
,
a
s
)
:
A
s
(
n
)


The schema for inductive types and families is a type-theoretic
generalization of a schema for iterated inductive definitions in
predicate logic (formulated in natural deduction) presented by
Martin-Löf (1971b). This paper immediately preceded
Martin-Löf’s first version of intuitionistic type
theory. It is both conceptually and technically a forerunner to the
development of the theory.


It is an essential feature of proof assistants such as Agda and Coq
that it enables users to define their own inductive types and families
by listing their introduction rules (the types of their
constructors). This is much like in typed functional programming
languages such as Haskell and the different dialects of ML. However,
unlike in these programming languages the schema for inductive
definitions in intuitionistic type theory enforces a restriction
amounting to well-foundedness of the elements of the defined
types.


4.6 Inductive-Recursive Definitions


We already mentioned that there are two main definition principles
in intuitionistic type theory: the inductive definition of types
(sets) and the (primitive, structural) definition of functions by
recursion on the way the elements of such types are inductively
generated. Usually, the inductive definition of a set comes first: the
formation and introduction rules make no reference to the elimination
rule. However, there are definitions in intuitionistic type theory for
which this is not the case and we simultaneously inductively generate
a type and a function from that type defined by structural
recursion. Such definitions are
simultaneously 
inductive-recursive
.


The first example of such an inductive-recursive definition is an
alternative formulation 
à la Tarski
 of the universe of small
types. Above we presented the universe formulated 
à la
Russell
, where there is no notational distinction between the
element 
A
:
U
 and the corresponding type 
A
. For a
universe 
à la
 Tarski there is such a distinction, for
example, between the element 
N
^
:
U
 and the corresponding
type 
N
. The element 
N
^
 is called the 
code
 for

N
.


The elimination rule for the universe 
à la
 Tarski is:


Γ
⊢
a
:
U
Γ
⊢
T
(
a
)


This expresses that there is a function 
T
 which maps a code

a
 to its corresponding type 
T
(
a
)
. The equality rules define
this correspondence. For example,


T
(
N
^
)
=
N
.


We see that 
U
 is inductively generated with one introduction
rule for each small type former, and 
T
 is defined by recursion on
these small type formers. The simultaneous inductive-recursive nature
of this definition becomes apparent in the rules for 
Π
 for
example. The introduction rule is


Γ
⊢
a
:
U
Γ
,
x
:
T
(
a
)
⊢
b
:
U
Γ
⊢
Π
^
x
:
a
.
b
:
U


and the corresponding equality rule is


T
(
Π
^
x
:
a
.
b
)
=
Π
x
:
T
(
a
)
.
T
(
b
)



Note that the introduction rule for 
U
 refers to 
T
, and hence
that 
U
 and 
T
 must be defined simultaneously.


There are a number of other universe constructions which are
defined inductive-recursively: universe hierarchies, superuniverses
(Palmgren 1998; Rathjen, Griffor, and Palmgren 1998), and Mahlo
universes (Setzer 2000). These universes are analogues of certain
large cardinals in set theory: inaccessible, hyperinaccessible, and
Mahlo cardinals.


Other examples of inductive-recursive definitions include an
informal definition of computability predicates used by Martin-Löf in
an early normalization proof of intuitionistic type theory (Martin-Löf
1998 [1972]). There are also many natural examples of “small”
inductive-recursive definitions, where the recursively defined
(decoding) function returns an element of a type rather than a
type.


A large class of inductive-recursive definitions, including the
above, can be captured by a general schema (Dybjer 2000) which extends
the schema for inductive definitions mentioned above. As shown by
Setzer, intuitionistic type theory with this class of
inductive-recursive definitions is very strong proof-theoretically
(Dybjer and Setzer 2003). However, as proposed in recent unpublished
work by Setzer, it is possible to increase the strength of the theory
even further and define universes such as an 
autonomous Mahlo
universe
 which are analogues of even larger cardinals.


5. Meaning Explanations


The consistency of intuitionistic type theory relative to set
theory can be proved by model constructions. Perhaps the simplest
method is an interpretation whereby each type-theoretic concept is
given its corresponding set-theoretic meaning, as outlined
in 
 
section 2.3
. For example the type of functions 
A
→
B

is interpreted as the set of all functions in the set-theoretic sense
between the set denoted by 
A
 and the set denoted by 
B
. To
interpret 
U
 we need a set-theoretic universe which is closed under
all (set-theoretic analogues of) the type constructors. Such a
universe can be proved to exist if we assume the existence of an
inaccessible cardinal 
κ
 and interpret 
U
 by 
V
κ

in the cumulative hierarchy.


Alternatives are realizability models, and for intensional type
theory, a model of terms in normal forms. The latter can also be used
for proving decidability of the judgments of the theory.


Mathematical models only prove consistency relative to classical
set theory (or whatever other meta-theory we are using). Is it
possible to be convinced about the consistency of the theory in a more
direct way, so called 
simple minded consistency

(Martin-Löf 1984)? In fact, is there a way to explain what
it 
means
 for a judgment to be correct in a
direct 
pre-mathematical
 way? And given that we know what the
judgments mean can we then be convinced that the inference rules of
the theory are valid? An answer to this problem was proposed by
Martin-Löf in 1979 in the paper “Constructive Mathematics
and Computer Programming” (Martin-Löf 1982) and elaborated
later on in numerous lectures and notes, see for example,
Martin-Löf (1984, 1987). These meaning explanations for
intuitionistic type theory are also referred to as the 
direct
semantics
, 
intuitive semantics
, 
informal
semantics
, 
standard semantics
, or
the 
syntactico-semantical
 approach to meaning theory.


This meaning theory follows the Wittgensteinian meaning-as-use
tradition. The meaning is based on rules for building objects
(introduction rules) of types and computation rules (elimination
rules) for computing with these objects. A difference from much of the
Wittgensteinian tradition is that also higher order types like 
N
→
N
 are given meaning using rules.


To explain the meaning of a judgment we must first know how the
terms in the judgment are computed to canonical form. Then the
formation rules explain how correct canonical types are built and the
introduction rules explain how correct canonical objects of such
canonical types are built. We quote (Martin-Löf 1982):



A canonical type 
A
 is defined by prescribing how a canonical
object of type 
A
 is formed as well as how two equal canonical
objects of type 
A
 are formed. There is no limitation on this
prescription except that the relation of equality which it defines
between canonical objects of type 
A
 must be reflexive, symmetric
and transitive.


 
In other words, a canonical type is equipped with an equivalence
relation on the canonical objects. Below we shall give a simplified
form of the meaning explanations, where this equivalence relation is
extensional identity of objects.


In spite of the 
pre-mathematical
 nature of this meaning
theory, its technical aspects can be captured as a mathematical model
construction similar to Kleene’s 
realizability
 interpretation
of intuitionistic logic, see the next section. The realizers here are
the terms of type theory rather than the number realizers used by
Kleene.


5.1 Computation to Canonical Form


The meaning of a judgment is explained in terms of the computation
of the types and terms in the judgment. These computations stop when a
canonical form is reached. By canonical form we mean a term where the outermost form is a constructor (introduction form). These are the canonical forms used in lazy
functional programming (for example in the Haskell language).


For the purpose of illustration we consider meaning explanations
only for three type formers: 
N
,
Π
x
:
A
.
B
, and 
U
. The
context free grammar for the terms of this fragment of Intuitionistic
Type Theory is as follows:


a
::=
0
∣
s
(
a
)
∣
λ
x
.
a
∣
N
∣
Π
x
:
a
.
a
∣
U
∣
R
(
a
,
a
,
x
x
.
a
)
∣
a
a
.


The canonical terms are generated by the following grammar:


v
::=
0
∣
s
(
a
)
∣
λ
x
.
a
∣
N
∣
Π
x
:
a
.
a
∣
U
,


where 
a
 ranges over arbitrary, not necessarily canonical,
terms. Note that 
s
(
a
)
 is canonical even if 
a
 is not.


To explain how terms are computed to canonical form, we introduce the relation 
a
⇒
v
 between 
closed
 terms 
a
 and canonical forms (values)

v
 given by the following computation rules:


c
⇒
0
d
⇒
v
R
(
c
,
d
,
x
y
.
e
)
⇒
v
c
⇒
s
(
a
)
e
[
x
:=
d
,
y
:=
R
(
a
,
d
,
x
y
.
e
)
]
⇒
v
R
(
c
,
d
,
x
y
.
e
)
⇒
v


f
⇒
λ
x
.
b
b
[
x
:=
a
]
⇒
v
f
a
⇒
v


in addition to the rule


v
⇒
v


stating that a canonical term has itself as value.


5.2 The Meaning of Categorical Judgments


A categorical judgment is a judgment where the context is empty and
there are no free variables.


The meaning of the categorical judgment 
⊢
A
 is that 
A

has a canonical type as value. In our fragment this means that either
of the following holds:






A
⇒
N
,






A
⇒
U
,






A
⇒
Π
x
:
B
.
C
 and furthermore that 
⊢
B
 and

x
:
B
⊢
C
.






The meaning of the categorical judgment 
⊢
a
:
A
 is that

a
 has a canonical term of the canonical type of 
A
 as value. In
our fragment this means that either of the following holds:






A
⇒
N
 and either 
a
⇒
0
 or 
a
⇒
s
(
b
)
 and 
⊢
b
:
N
,






A
⇒
U
 and either 
a
⇒
N
 or 
a
⇒
Π
x
:
b
.
c
 where furthermore 
⊢
b
:
U
 and
    
x
:
b
⊢
c
:
U
,






A
⇒
Π
x
:
B
.
C
 and 
a
⇒
λ
x
.
c
 and

x
:
B
⊢
c
:
C
.






The meaning of the categorical judgment 
⊢
A
=
A
′
 is
that 
A
 and 
A
′
 have the same canonical types as values. In
our fragment this means that either of the following holds:






A
⇒
N
 and 
A
′
⇒
N
,






A
⇒
U
 and 
A
′
⇒
U
,






A
⇒
Π
x
:
B
.
C
 and 
A
′
⇒
Π
x
:
B
′
.
C
′
 and furthermore that 
⊢
B
=
B
′
 and 
x
:
B
⊢
C
=
C
′
.






The meaning of the categorical judgment 
⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A

is explained in a similar way.


It is a tacit assumption of the meaning explanations that the
repeated computations of canonical forms is well-founded. For example,
a natural number is the result of finitely many computations of the
successor function 
s
 ended by 
0
. A computation which results
in infinitely many computations of 
s
 is not a natural number in
intuitionistic type theory. (However, there are extensions of type
theory, for example, partial type theory, and non-standard type
theory, where such infinite computations can occur,
see 
section 7.3
. To justify the rules of such
theories the present meaning explanations do not suffice.)


5.3 The Meaning of Hypothetical Judgments


According to Martin-Löf (1982) the meaning of a hypothetical
judgment is reduced to the meaning of the categorical judgments by
substituting the closed terms of appropriate types for the free
variables. For example, the meaning of


x
1
:
A
1
,
…
,
x
n
:
A
n
⊢
a
:
A


is that the categorical judgment


⊢
a
[
x
1
:=
a
1
,
…
,
x
n
:=
a
n
]
:
A
[
x
1
:=
a
1
,
…
,
x
n
:=
a
n
]


is valid whenever the categorical judgments




⊢
a
1
:
A
1
,
…
,
⊢
a
n
[
x
1
:=
a
1
,
…
,
x
n
−
1
:=
a
n
−
1
]
:
A
n
[
x
1
:=
a
1
,
…
,
x
n
−
1
:=
a
n
−
1
]




are valid.


6. Mathematical Models


6.1 Categorical Models


6.1.1 Hyperdoctrines


Curry’s correspondence between propositions and types was extended
to predicate logic in the late 1960s by Howard (1980) and de Bruijn
(1970). At around the same time Lawvere developed related ideas in
categorical logic. In particular he proposed the notion of
a 
hyperdoctrine
 (Lawvere 1970) as a categorical model of
(typed) predicate logic. A hyperdoctrine is an indexed category 
P
:
T
o
p
→
Cat
, where 
T
 is a category where the
objects represent types and the arrows represent terms. If 
A
 is a
type then the 
fibre
 
P
(
A
)
 is a category of propositions
depending on a variable 
x
:
A
. The arrows in this category are
proofs 
Q
⊢
R
 and can be thought of as
proof-objects. Moreover, since we have an indexed category, for each
arrow 
t
 from 
A
 to 
B
, there is a reindexing functor 
P
(
B
)
→
P
(
A
)
 representing substitution of 
t
 for a variable

y
:
B
. The category 
P
(
A
)
 is assumed to be cartesian closed and
conjunction and implications are modelled by products and exponentials
in this category. The quantifiers 
∃
 and 
∀
 are
modelled by the left and right adjoints of the reindexing
functor. Moreover, Lawvere added further structure to hyperdoctrines
to model identity propositions (as left adjoints to a diagonal
functor) and a comprehension schema.


6.1.2 Contextual categories, categories with attributes, and categories with families


Lawvere’s definition of hyperdoctrines preceded intuitionistic type
theory but did not go all the way to identifying propositions and types. Nevertheless Lawvere influenced
Scott’s (1970) work on 
constructive validity
, a somewhat
preliminary precursor of intuitionistic type theory. After Martin-Löf
(1998 [1972]) had presented a
more definite formulation of the theory, the first work on categorical
models was presented by Cartmell in 1978 with his notions of category
with attributes and contextual category (Cartmell 1986). However, we
will not define these structures here but instead the closely
related 
categories with families
 (Dybjer 1996) which are
formulated so that they directly model a variable-free version of a
formulation of intuitionistic type theory with explicit substitutions
(Martin-Löf 1995).


A category with families is a functor 
T
:
C
o
p
→
Fam
, where 
Fam
 is the category of families of
sets. The category 
C
 is the category of contexts and
substitutions. If 
Γ
 is an object of 
C
 (a context), then

T
(
Γ
)
 is the family of terms of type 
A
 which depend on
variables in 
Γ
. If 
γ
 is an arrow in 
C

representing a substitution, then the arrow part of the functor
represents substitution of 
γ
 in types and terms. A category
with families also has a terminal object and a notion of context
comprehension, reminiscent of Lawvere’s comprehension in
hyperdoctrines. The terminal object captures the rules for empty
contexts and empty substitutions. Context comprehension captures the
rules for extending contexts and substitutions, and has projections
capturing weakening and assumption of the last variable.


Categories with families are algebraic structures which model the
general rules of dependent type theory, those which come before the
rules for specific type formers, such as 
Π
, 
Σ
, identity
types, universes, etc. In order to model specific type-former
corresponding extra structure needs to be added.


6.1.3 Locally cartesian closed categories


From a categorical perspective the above-mentioned structures may
appear somewhat special and ad hoc. A more regular structure which
gives rise to models of intuitionistic type theory are the locally
cartesian closed categories. These are categories with a terminal
object, where each slice category is cartesian closed. It can be shown
that the pullback functor has a left and a right adjoint, representing

Σ
- and 
Π
-types, respectively. Locally cartesian closed
categories correspond to intuitionistic type theory with extensional
identity types and 
Σ
 and 
Π
-types (Seely 1984,
Clairambault and Dybjer 2014). It should be remarked that the
correspondence with intuitionistic type theory is somewhat indirect,
since a coherence problem, in the sense of category theory, needs to
be solved. The problem is that in locally cartesian closed categories
type substituion is represented by pullbacks, but these are only
defined up to isomorphism, see Curien 1993 and Hofmann 1994.


6.2 Set-Theoretic Model


Intuitionistic type theory is a possible framework for constructive
mathematics in Bishop’s sense. Such constructive mathematics is
compatible with classical mathematics: a constructive proof in
Bishop’s sense can directly be understood as a proof in classical
logic. A formal way to understand this is by constructing a
set-theoretic model of intuitionistic type theory, where each concept
of type theory is interpreted as the corresponding concept in
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. For example, a type is interpreted as a
set, and the type of functions in 
A
→
B
 is interpreted
as the set of all functions in the set-theoretic sense from the set
representing 
A
 to the set representing 
B
. The type of natural
numbers is interpreted as the set of natural numbers. The
interpretations of identity types, and 
Σ
 and 
Π
-types
were already discussed in the introduction. And as already mentioned,
to interpret the type-theoretic universe we need an inaccessible
cardinal.


6.2.1 Model in CZF


It can be shown that the interpretation outlined above can be
carried out in Aczel’s constructive set theory CZF. Hence it does not
depend on classical logic or impredicative features of set theory.


6.3 Realizability Models


The set-theoretic model can be criticized on the grounds that it
models the type of functions as the set of all set-theoretic
functions, in spite of the fact that a function in type theory is
always computable, whereas a set-theoretic function may not be.


To remedy this problem one can instead construct
a 
realizability model
 whereby one starts with a set
of 
realizers
. One can here follow Kleene’s numerical
realizability closely where functions are realized by codes for Turing
machines. Or alternatively, one can let realizers be terms in a lambda
calculus or combinatory logic possibly extended with appropriate
constants. Types are then represented by sets of realizers, or often
as partial equivalence relations on the set of realizers. A partial
equivalence relation is a convenient way to represent a type with a
notion of “equality” on it.


There are many variations on the theme of realizability model. Some
such models tacitly
assume set theory as the metatheory (Aczel 1980, Beeson 1985), whereas others explictly assume a
constructive metatheory (Smith 1984).


Realizability models are also models of the extensional version of
intuitionistic type theory (Martin-Löf 1982) which will be presented
in 
section 7.1
 below.


6.4 Model of Normal Forms and Type-Checking


In intuitionistic type theory each type and each well-typed term
has a normal form. A consequence of this normal form property is that
all the judgments are decidable: for example, given a correct context

Γ
, a correct type 
A
 and a possibly ill-typed term 
a
,
there is an algorithm for deciding whether 
Γ
⊢
a
:
A
. This type-checking algorithm is the key component of
proof-assistants for Intensional Type Theory, such as Agda.


The correctness of the normal form property can be expressed as a
model of normal forms, where each context, type, and term are
interpreted as their respective normal forms.


7. Variants of the Theory


7.1 Extensional Type Theory


In extensional intuitionistic type theory (Martin-Löf 1982) the
rules of 
I
-elimination and 
I
-equality for the general identity
type are replaced by the following two rules:


Γ
⊢
c
:
I
(
A
,
a
,
a
′
)
Γ
⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A
Γ
⊢
c
:
I
(
A
,
a
,
a
′
)
Γ
⊢
c
=
r
:
I
(
A
,
a
,
a
′
)



The first causes the distinction between
propositional and judgmental equality to disappear. The second forces
identity proofs to be unique. Unlike the rules for the intensional
identity type former, the rules for extensional identity types do not
fit into the schema for inductively defined types mentioned above.


These rules are however justified by the meaning explanations in
Martin-Löf (1982). This is because the categorical judgment


⊢
c
:
I
(
A
,
a
,
a
′
)


is valid iff 
c
⇒
r
 and the judgment 
⊢
a
=
a
′
:
A
 is valid.


However, these rules make it possible to define terms without
normal forms. Since the type-checking algorithm relies on the
computation of normal forms of types, it no longer works for
extensional type theory, see (Castellan, Clairambault, and Dybjer 2015).


On the other hand, certain constructions which are not available in
intensional type theory are possible in extensional type theory. For
example, function extensionality


(
Π
x
:
A
.
I
(
B
,
f
x
,
f
′
x
)
)
→
I
(
Π
x
:
A
.
B
,
f
,
f
′
)


is a theorem.


Another example is that 
W
-types can be used for encoding other
inductively defined types in Extensional Type Theory. For example, the
Brouwer ordinals of the second and higher number classes can be
defined as special instances of the 
W
-type (Martin-Löf 1984). More
generally, it can be shown that all inductively defined types which
are given by a 
strictly positive type operator
 can be
represented as instances of well-founded trees (Dybjer 1997).


7.2 Univalent Foundations and Homotopy Type Theory


Univalent foundations refer to Voevodsky’s programme for a new
foundation of mathematics based on intuitionistic type theory and
employing ideas from homotopy theory. Here every type 
A
 is
considered as a space, and the identity type 
I
(
A
,
a
,
b
)
 is the space
of paths from point 
a
 to point 
b
 in 
A
. Iterated identity types represent higher homotopies, e.g.


I
(
I
(
A
,
a
,
b
)
,
f
,
g
)


is the space of homotopies between 
f
 and 
g
.
The notion of
ordinary set can be thought of as a discrete space 
A
 where
all paths in 
I
(
A
,
a
,
b
)
 are trivial loops.




The origin of these ideas
was the remarkable discovery by (Hofmann and Streicher 1998) that the axioms of
intensional type theory do not force all proofs of an identity to be equal, that is, not all paths need to be trivial. This was
shown by a model construction where each type is interpreted as a
groupoid. 



Further connections between identity
types and notions from homotopy theory and higher categories were
subsequently discovered by (Awodey and Warren 2009), (Lumsdaine 2010), and
(van den Berg and Garner 2011). Voevodsky realized that the whole intensional intuitionistic type
theory could be modelled by a well-known category studied in homotopy
theory, namely the Kan simplicial sets. Inspired by this model he
introduced the 
univalence axiom
. For a universe

U
 of small types, this axiom states that the substitution map associated with
the 
J
-operator


I
(
U
,
a
,
b
)
⟶
T
(
a
)
≅
T
(
b
)



is an equivalence. Equivalence (
≅
) here refers to a general notion of
equivalence of higher dimensional objects, as in the
sequence 
equal elements, isomorphic sets, equivalent groupoids,
biequivalent bigroupoids
, etc. The univalence axiom expresses
that “everything is preserved by equivalence”, thereby
realizing the informal categorical slogan that all categorical
constructions are preserved by isomorphism, and its generalization,
that all constructions of categories are preserved by equivalence of
categories, etc.


The axiom of univalence was originally justified by
Voevodsky’s simplical set model. This model is however not
constructive and (Bezem, Coquand and Huber 2014 [2013]) has more
recently proposed a model in Kan cubical sets.


Although univalent foundations concern preservation of mathematical
structure in general, strongly inspired by category theory,
applications within homotopy theory are particularly actively
investigated. Intensional type theory extended with the univalence
axiom and so called higher inductive types is therefore also called
“homotopy type theory”. We refer to the entry on
 
type theory
 for further details.


7.3 Partial and Non-Standard Type Theory


Intuitionistic type theory is not intended to model Brouwer’s
notion of 
free choice sequence
, although lawlike choice
sequences can be modelled as functions from 
N
. However, there are
extensions of the theory which incorporate such choice sequences:
namely 
partial type theory
 and 
non-standard type
theory
 (Martin-Löf 1990). The types in partial type theory
can be interpreted as Scott domains (Martin-Löf 1986, Palmgren
and Stoltenberg-Hansen 1990, Palmgren 1991). In this way a type 
N

which contains an infinite number 
∞
 can be
interpreted. However, in partial type theory all types are inhabited
by a least element 
⊥
, and thus the propositions as types
principle is not maintained. Non-standard type theory incorporates
non-standard elements, such as an infinite number 
∞
:
N

without inhabiting all types.


7.4 Impredicative Type Theory


The inconsistent version of intuitionistic type theory of
Martin-Löf (1971a) was based on the strongly impredicative axiom that
there is a type of all types. However, (Coquand and Huet 1988) showed with their
calculus of constructions, that there is a powerful impredicative but
consistent version of type theory. In this theory the universe 
U

(usually called 
P
r
o
p
 in this theory) is closed under the following formation rule
for cartesian product of families of types:


Γ
⊢
A
Γ
,
x
:
A
⊢
B
:
U
Γ
⊢
Π
x
:
A
.
B
:
U


This rule is more general than the rule for constructing small
cartesian products of families of small types in intuitionistic type
theory, since we can now quantify over arbitrary types 
A
,
including 
U
, and not just small types. We say that 
U
 is impredicative since we can construct a new element of it by quantifying over all elements, even the element which is constructed.


The motivation for this theory was that inductively defined types
and families of types become definable in terms of impredicative
quantification. For example, the type of natural numbers can be
defined as the type of Church numerals:


N
=
Π
X
:
U
.
X
→
(
X
→
X
)
→
X
:
U


This is an impredicative definition, since it is a small type which
is constructed by quantification over all small types. Similarly we
can define an identity type by impredicative quantification:


I
(
A
,
a
,
a
′
)
=
Π
X
:
A
→
U
.
X
a
→
X
a
′
:
U


This is Leibniz’ definition of equality: 
a
 and 
a
′
 are
equal iff they satisfy the same properties (ranged over by 
X
).


Unlike in intuitionistic type theory, the function type in
impredicative type cannot be interpreted set-theoretically in a
straightfoward way, see (Reynolds 1984).


7.5 Proof Assistants


In 1979 Martin-Löf wrote the paper “Constructive Mathematics
and Computer Programming” where he explained that intuitionistic
type theory is a programming language which can also be used as a
formal foundation for constructive mathematics. Shortly after that,
interactive proof systems which help the user to derive valid
judgments in the theory, so called proof assistants, were
developed.


One of the first systems was the NuPrl system (PRL Group 1986),
which is based on an extensional type theory similar to (Martin-Löf
1982).


Systems based on versions of intensional type theory go back to the
type-checker for the impredicative calculus of constructions which was
written around 1984 by Coquand and Huet. This led to the Coq system,
which is based on the calculus of inductive constructions
(Paulin-Mohring 1993), a theory which extends the calculus of
construction with primitive inductive types and families. The
encodings of the pure calculus of constructions were found to be
inconvenient, since the full elimination rules could not be derived
and instead had to be postulated. We also remark that the calculus of
inductive constructions has a subsystem, the predicative calculus of
inductive constructions, which follows the principles of
Martin-Löf’s intuitionistic type theory.


Agda is another proof assistant which is based on the logical
framework formulation of intuitionistic type theory, but adds numerous
features inspired by practical programming languages (Norell 2008). It
is an intensional theory with decidable judgments and a type-checker
similar to Coq’s. However, in contrast to Coq it is based on
Martin-Löf’s predicative intuitionistic type theory.


There are several other systems based either on the calculus of
constructions (Lego, Matita, Lean) or on intuitionistic type theory
(Epigram, Idris); see (Pollack 1994; Asperti 
et al.
 2011; de Moura 
et al.
 2015;
McBride and McKinna 2004; Brady 2011).
